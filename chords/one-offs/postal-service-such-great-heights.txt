"Such Great Heights" by the Postal Service, as covered by Ben Folds

F                    Am
I am thinking it's a sign
                         Gm              
That the freckles in our eyes
                      Bb
Are mirror images and when
                          F
We kiss they're perfectly aligned

              Am
And I have to speculate
                     Gm
That God himself did make
                      Bb
Us into corresponding shapes
                            F
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

                             Am
And true, it may seem like a stretch,
                                Gm
But its thoughts like this that catch
                             Bb
My troubled head when you're away
                         F
When I am missing you to death

                              Am
When you are out there on the road
                     Gm
For several weeks of shows
                      Bb
And when you scan the radio,
                               
I hope this song will guide you

F                             C   
They will see us waving from such great heights,
      Gm                 Am
"Come down now," they'll say
    F                             C
But everything looks perfect from far away,
      Gm             Am
"Come down now," but we'll stay...

F                  Am
I tried my best to leave
                 Gm
This all on your machine
                           Bb
But the persistent beat it sounded thin upon listening

F                         Am
And that frankly will not fly.
                            Gm
You will hear the shrillest highs
                                 Bb
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

F                             C
They won't see us waving from such great heights,
      Gm                 Am
"Come down now," they'll say
    F                             C
But everything looks perfect from far away,
      Gm                   Am
"Come down now," but we'll stay...

But everything looks perfect from far away,

"Come down now,"

F                             C

"Come down now," but we'll stay...
