Enough of the singin', let's make love
In between the sheets
Oh, I like the way you receive me (Receive me, receive me)
Girl, I love the way you relieve me

(Sweet darlin') In between the sheets
Oh, I like the way you receive me (Receive me, receive me)
Girl, I love the way you relieve me
Comin', comin' on strong (Comin' on strong)

You got me moanin'
Girl, you got me groanin'
I'm comin', comin' on strong
(Sweet darlin') In between the sheets
Let's get all the way down
Turn it over

(Sweet darlin') In between the sheets
