B                     E          F#
If I had you I'd hold you like a guitar
B                       E           F#
I could slay you with a well-placed F sharp barre
B                              D#                                    G#m
If you don't want to hear that tune I'll leave my fingers where they are

          E               G#m            E
And every time I see your face I want to touch it
      G#m             E
And I know I'll never touch it
      C#        E
I get by, I get by

And I can't tell how hard I tried
I can't reveal what I can't hide
I said that I was fine, I lied
But I can stick around and see you smile from the side

I say William Shakespeare had the right idea
Put your passion in a poem she won't hear
If your heart is whole again you can publish it next year

And every time I see your neck I want to kiss it
And I know I'll never kiss it
I get by, I get by

And I've been in my head too long
To know when what I think is wrong
But I can write another song
And I can stick around and see you as you sing along

I had another set of words to use instead of what I'm singing here
The rhymes were intricate and every line was filled with alliteration and the best poetic tricks
It demonstrated just how clearly I'm the perfect guy for you to hear
But in reality perfection isn't really what we want so we just throw words at the page
And we call it a masterpiece if any part of it sticks

I've been waiting on another bright idea
I've been waiting on another bright idea
I've been waiting on another bright idea
I've been waiting on another bright idea
I've been waiting on another bright idea
I've been waiting on another bright idea
I've been waiting on another bright idea
I've been working on a song that you won't hear
I've been working on a song that you won't hear
I've been working on a song for you, dear

And everybody tells me that I'm fine
And everybody tells me not to mind
And everybody says just toe the line
And everybody tells me that the world was made for me to play in but I don't believe them
