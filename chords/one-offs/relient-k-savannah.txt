[INTRO]
Db Gb Gbm Db

[VERSE 1]
  Db
Savannah
                          Gb
I hope to be there by the morning
                             Gbm
And see this pining all transforming
                             Db
Into the arms of the Georgia sun
  Db
Savannah
                              Gb
I'd love to feel the heat the sunrise
                                         Gbm
Brushing rays across my windshield as if one dries
                        Db
The streams from off my face

[CHORUS 1]
    Gb                           
Yet I know you'll be there 'cause you'll know
                             Db
I'll want you to be there and we'll say hello 
                     Gb
As you're smiling in love and we'll sigh so relieved 
                  Db
I believe because we will both know by tonight 
                  Ab
We'll feel normal again
      Db
But until then
  Ab
Until then
  Db
Until then

[VERSE 2]
  Db
Savannah
                         Gb
Our backs supported by a hammock
                            Gbm
We sum up perfection like a handbook
                         Db
And God knows it all too well
  Db
Savannah
                            Gb
We'll take a walk to find a gift shop
                                   Gbm
Who would've thought the book that you bought
                         Db
Would never come off the shelf

[CHORUS 2]
    Gb                           
Yet I know you'll be there 'cause you'll know
                             Db
I'll want you to be there and we'll say hello 
                     Gb
As you're smiling in love and we'll sigh so relieved 
                  Db
I believe because we will both know by tonight 
                  Ab
We'll feel normal again
      Db
But until then
  Ab
Until then
  Db
Until then

[BRIDGE]
Db
Baby
  Gb
I spent my life wondering
                   Db
Wondering when I'd find you
               Gb                             Db
I searched for all these years and now you're right here
  Gb
I need you to know that
Ab               Gb                     Db
Everything makes sense when you're with me

[VERSE 3]
  Db
Savannah
                         Gb
Walk out into the sultry evening
                          Gbm
Cotton breathing when the sea winds
                                Db
Brush the hair down around your neck
  Db
Savannah
                               Gb
You hold my hand like it's the first time
                              Gbm
And all the feelings that our hearts find
                       Db
Will be just what we expect

[CHORUS 3]
    Gb                           
Yet I know you'll be there 'cause you'll know
                             Db
I'll want you to be there and we'll say hello 
                     Gb
As you're smiling in love and we'll sigh so relieved 
                  Db
I believe because we will both know by tonight 
                  Ab
We'll feel normal again
      Db
But until then
  Ab
Until then
  Db
Until then
