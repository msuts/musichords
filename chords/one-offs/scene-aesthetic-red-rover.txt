[VERSE 1]
     A2    Dmaj9
It's about time
                         A2        Dmaj9
To take a chance & let myself slip through
                          A2        Dmaj9
It's been a while since i felt like this
                 A2    Dmaj9
Did it happen to you?
             A2       Dmaj9
We've come a long way since
                          A2     Dmaj9
I saw you sitting in that living room
                             A2      Dmaj9
You rolled your eyes at me & that is fine
                         A2        Dmaj9
Because we finally broke through

[PRECHORUS 1]
     D          A/C#          Esus4         A
It's always the same with the games that we play
          D              A/C#        Esus4     A
Where the boys chase the girls & the girls run away
        D          A/C#         Esus4              A
But you never went running, I'm surprised that you stayed
    A2       Dmaj9  
For me, with me

[CHORUS 1]
A2                    D
I'll continue to keep saying the things that i say
A2                         D                        
And we'll continue to keep playing the games that we play
                    Dm                 A2   Dmaj9                  
And maybe just this once we'll work it out

[VERSE 2]
Dmaj9       A2               Dmaj9
You're not alone, confide in me
       A2                   Dmaj9
For anything your heart may need
     A2              E
I am always here for you (always always always)
Dmaj9       A2             Dmaj9
We've come across a lot of things 
               A2                 Dmaj9
Throughout our lives but you will see
       A2            E
I will always follow through
Bm                       Dm
Don't ever worry you are never alone in this

[CHORUS 2]
A2                    D
I'll continue to keep saying the things that i say
A2                         D                        
And we'll continue to keep playing the games that we play
                    Dm                 A2                  
And maybe just this once we'll work it out

[OUTRO]

A2                         D                        
And we'll continue to keep playing the games that we play

And maybe just this once we'll work it out (it out it out work it out it out it out)
