Unreleased song featured on One Hand Clapping, the reissue of the McCartney album, and the Michael Parkinson Show in 1999.

INTRO:
G9
Girls it's been my pleasure
   C            C6  G/B Am
To know quite a lot of  you.
    Dm
And in the main
       G9                C
You're pretty sane, it's true.
          Am    Dm7
But there are a few who do to
G9                         C
doo ti doo too beautiful a job.
Ddim7                    C
It isn't quite what they planned
         Ddim7        G7    C
When the man gets the upper hand.
     Ddim7            C
He's takin' her for a ride.
Ddim7    G7 C
I'd call it suicide.

VERSE:
C           Dm7      Em  Eb
If when she tries to run away
       G/D       G         C
And he calls her back, she comes.
C            Dm7        Em   Eb
If there's a next time, he's okay
            G/D   G        C
Cause she's under both his thumbs.

CHORUS:
Em              Eb
She limps along to his side
Dm7               G
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
C           C/E     F 
bet he says nothin' doin'.
        C   Em Eb Dm   G  C   
I-I-I-I I'd       call it suicide.

VERSE:
She loves to ride in big parades.
But he wouldn't so she won't.
She needs at least a dozen maids.
But if he says no she don't.

CHORUS:
He wishes she knew his side.
Soon there'll be trouble brewin' I'd
bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide.

BRIDGE:
C C/E F        G7 
Suicide, she's commitin' it
C C/E F           G7
Suicide, he's not gettin' it
C C/E F         G7         C
Suicide, it's a quittin' a day.

(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE W/WORDLESS VOCAL)

CHORUS:
She limps along to his side
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
bet he says nothin' doin'.
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide.

OUTRO:
Suicide, she's commitin' it
Suicide, he's not gettin' it
Suicide, it's a quittin' a day.
