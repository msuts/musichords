SUICIDE by PAUL MCCARTNEY
Unreleased, recorded 1970

[INTRO]
G9
  Girls it's been my pleasure
   C            C6  G/B  Am
To know quite a lot of   you
    Dm
And in the main
       G9                C
You're pretty sane, it's true
          Am    Dm7
But there are a few who do to
G9                         C
doo ti doo too beautiful a job
   Ddim7                   C
It isn't quite what they planned
         Ddim7        G7        C
When the man gets the   upper hand
     Ddim7            C
He's takin' her for a ride
Ddim7        G7   C
   I'd call it suicide

[VERSE 1]
C             Dm7      Em     Eb
  If when she tries to   run away
       G/D       G         C
And he calls her back, she comes
C              Dm7        Em      Eb
  If there's a next time,   he's okay
            G/D   G        C
Cause she's under both his thumbs

[CHORUS 1]
Em                Eb
  She limps along   to his side
Dm7               G
Singing a song of ruin, I'd
C           C/E     F 
bet he says nothin' doin'
        C   Em Eb Dm   G  C   
I-I-I-I I'd       call it suicide

[VERSE 2]
C              Dm7     Em      Eb
  She loves to ride in   big parades
       G/D      G      C
But he wouldn't so she won't
C              Dm7     Em      Eb
  She needs at least a   dozen maids
       G/D     G      C
But if he says no she don't

[CHORUS 2]
Em              Eb
  He wishes she   knew his side.
Dm7                      G
Soon there'll be trouble brewin', I'd
C           C/E     F 
bet he says nothin' doin'
        C   Em Eb Dm   G  C   
I-I-I-I I'd       call it suicide

[BRIDGE]
C  C/E  F        G7 
Suicide, she's commitin' it
C  C/E  F         G7
Suicide, he's not gettin' it
C  C/E  F       G7         C
Suicide, it's a quittin' a day

[CHORUS 3]
Em                Eb
  She limps along   to his side
Dm7               G
Singing a song of ruin, I'd
C           C/E     F 
bet he says nothin' doin'
        C   Em Eb Dm   G  C   
I-I-I-I I'd       call it suicide
