The mist that settled on Central Park
   A7/C#                              Dm9           G
is clearing up and things are looking brighter now

   C6
So let's go walking before it's dark
    A7/C#			   Dm9        
the mayor of New York City says he might allow
    G               E7/G#         Am
the whole of ol' Manhattan to belong to us
     F           G
it's going for a song to us

    C6
the Frick Museum is shutting down
    A7/C#                             Dm9         G
but let's duck in and wander 'round a pick or two

C6          
Take a taxi and head downtown
      A7/C#                        Dm9
where every street magician does a trick for you
G                        E7/G#             Am
and the all the young respiring bards will throng to us
     F          G
they dedicate a song to us

Oh, zoot zoot zoot zoot zoot-ie zoot

End on C6
