  That's where I found my mandarin plum
Am7/D                D     C/D       F/G
  That's where you'd be if you found one
 
[CHORUS 1]
          Fmaj7      B7
Where the nights are bright
    Em7        Am7/G
And joy is complete

Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street

There's trouble      most every night
Am E7 Am
  Where once we danced our sweet routine
Am7/D          D        C/D  F/G
   It reeks of wine and kerosene

Gm9                   C9
   There's a special place for lovers

G9                   Gm7/C             A/F  Dm/F  A  Dm/A 
   There where neon bends in daylight sky
Cm7/F             F9         Eb/F
   In that sunny room she soothes me
Bbmaj7                 Ebmaj7
   Cools me with her fan
      Bm7
We're drifting
  B7/D#    B7           Bb/E
A thousand years roll by
