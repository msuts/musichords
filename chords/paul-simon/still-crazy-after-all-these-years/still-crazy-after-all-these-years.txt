I met my old lover on the street last night
    G                 Cdim/F#              Bsus4   B7  Em7 Ebm7
She seemed so glad to see    me    I just smiled
       Dm                G7               C                    C#dim7
And we talked about some old times And we drank ourselves some beers
      G/D         D7        Em      C#dim7
Still crazy after all these years   Oh...

I’m not the kind of man who tends to socialize
          G       Cdim/F#      Bsus4  B7   Em7 Ebm7
I seem to lean on old familiar ways
      Dm                G7              C             C#dim7
And I ain't no fool for love songs that whisper in my ears
      G/D         D7        Em      C#dim7
Still crazy after all these years   Oh...
      G/D         D7        G9

Now I sit by my window and I watch the cars

I fear I’ll do some damage one fine day
      A               A7/C#       D          D#dim7
But I would not be convicted by a jury of my peers

Still crazy after all these years,  Oh
