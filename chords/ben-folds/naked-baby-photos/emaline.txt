[INTRO]
Gmaj9  Dmaj9  A  Gmaj9
Gmaj9  Dmaj9  A  Gmaj9

[VERSE 1]
Gmaj9      Dmaj9          A
I wish it was     last September
                      Gmaj9
When we could lose ourselves in crowds everyday
           Dmaj9                 A
'Cause Emaline    don't walk in time
                           Gmaj9
She's not the same, that's all you can say

[CHORUS 1]
         E7                   
But when I've heard enough I tell myself
           E7/D    E7/G   Cmaj9
That we've learned our    lesson
            A                         Gmaj9
But I don't want to walk away from Emaline

[VERSE 2]
Dmaj9                  A       
       They're talking now
         Gmaj9
Does she know what they're saying?
               Dmaj9                  A
She's got the air     to float above it
                     Gmaj9
I'm sinking in this, someone should pay

              Dmaj9         A
She's dear to me and so expensive
            Gmaj9
Now I'm not talking 'bout money
            Dmaj9                A
When money talks, I hate to listen
                     Gmaj9
But lately it's been screaming in my ear

[CHORUS 2]
         E7
But when I've heard enough I tell myself
           E7/D#   E7/C#  Cmaj9
That we've learned our    lesson
            A                         Gmaj9  A Dmaj9
But I don't want to walk away from Emaline

[BRIDGE]
F#m7                     Gmaj9                  Dmaj9
     It only took me one look to understand Emaline
                                  E7
Sometimes I don't know what she's saying
Gmaj9
      Sometimes I do
                                  E7
Sometimes I don't know what she's    saying
            C
But I know, I know
                A
I know what she wants to believe

[PIANO SOLO]
Gmaj9             Dmaj9         A       Gmaj9
      I wish it was     last September

Gmaj9  Dmaj9  A  Gmaj9

Gmaj9  Dmaj9  A  Gmaj9

E7     C         G/A                      Gmaj9
           Don't let me walk away from Emaline

[VERSE 3]
Dmaj9                A
      For stupid reasons
        Gmaj9
Now I'm talking 'bout money
            Dmaj9               A
When money talks, I hate to listen
                     G        G/F#  Em7  G/D  Em7
But lately it's been scream - ing   in   my   ear

        Dmaj9             A
Want advice, girls need attention
           Gmaj9
Or are you different than all mine?
                Dmaj9            A
For what it's worth, she's got attention
                Gmaj9
For people like you   see black and white

[CHORUS 3]
     E7                    
When I've heard enough, I tell you what
       E7/D#    E7/C#  Cmaj9
Really should - n't    sit here and whine
     Gmaj9
I'll take you down to see my Emaline
