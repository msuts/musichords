Boxing by Ben Folds Five

Dashes in RH/LH breakdowns represent beats in 3/4 time. Plus signs on a beat mean to play the previous notation a second time and so on. Notes linked with dashes are eighth notes, notes linked with equals signs are 16th notes or faster. Notes linked with a tilde represent grace notes. If the formatting is incorrect, turn off word wrap or make Notepad full screen.

Howard, the strangest thing
Has happened lately
When I take a good swing
And all my dreams
They pivot and slip
I drop my fists and they're back
Laughing Howard
My intention's become not to lose what I've won
Ambition has given way to desperation and I
Lost the fight from my eyes

[Chorus]
Boxing's been good to me, Howard
Now I'm told, you're growing old
The whole time you knew
In a couple of years I'd be through
Has boxing been good to you?

Howard, now I confess I'm scared and lonely and tired
They seem to think I'm made of clay
Another day, not cut out for this
I just know what to say, I say

[Chorus]

Well sometimes I punch myself as hard as I can
Yelling nobody cares hoping someone will tell me how
Wrong I am

[Chorus]

Has boxing been good
Has boxing been good to you?
