          Dm                Gm                 Dm     (G#-A-E-F-C#-D-G#-A)
Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
          Dm              Gm             Dm
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
Dm   Am/E  F     F#dim  Gm
If   you   rea - lly    loved me she said
Am7        A7            Dm
I wouldn't have to be so mean

He's a heap of junk that pours from his top drawer
          Dm                 Gm             Dm
Sometimes likes to spread it out around the floor
     Dm   Am/E  F     F#dim  Gm 
It's ev - i -   dence of     what he was like
   Am       A7       Dm    (D-E-F-A-D-E-F gliss down)
He likes to remember when

In a minute it will all be coming down
         Dm              Gm             Dm
And they know it now but no one makes a sound
Dm   Am/E  F     F#dim  Gm
Such a     shame to     ruin this bright
Am   A7    Dm
Lazy sunny day

           Dm                     Gm                Dm
She said, "You've been pushing me like I was a sore tooth.
Dm                    Gm                      Dm
You can't respect me 'cause I've done so much for you."

He  said, "Well I      hate that it's come to this
    Am         A7              Dm    
But baby I was doing fine. How do you think
     Dm/C#          Dm/C         Dm/B
That I survived the other twenty-five before you?"
