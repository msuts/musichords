Underground by Ben Folds Five

Single note: Ab

I was never cool in school
             Baug
I'm sure you don't remember me
    B6/F# 
And now it's been 10 years
          F#
I'm still wondering who to be
        B6
But I'd love to mix
   Baug/E                B5/D#       B6/F
In circles, cliques, and social coteries - that's me
                      B/F#  F#5-7  B/F#       F# 
Hand me my nose ring (Can   we     be    ha - ppy?)
                      B/E  C#m-no5/E  B/E        E
Show me the mosh pit (Can  we         be    ha - ppy?)
B  Bsus4/C#  B5/D#  B6/E  B5maj7/D#  Bsus4/C#  B     A
We can       be     ha  - ppy        un -      der - ground

B  Baug  B6  Baug
B  Baug  B6  Baug

B             Baug                 B6
Who's got the looks, who's got the brains
          B7         B/F#
Who's got everything
E7         D#7        G#m7          F#m7
I got this pain in my heart, that's all
E                Em7      A2-7   B
Hey you with the long and lonely face
        D7        E7        C#m7/F#
There's got to be something else

               B              Baug
Let me tell ya something else
               B6                 B7  B/F#
There was this girl who passed me by
           E7              D#7
She gave a smile but I was shy
         G#m7     F#m7
I looked down, so down
E                       Em7  Em7/B  A2-7    B
Don't look there no no, go   go     under - ground
    Daug7         E           C#m7/F#
But now there's a place to go

Bmaj7                 
It's the morning now
B7/A
It's the evening
     B/G#
It's everything
G7         F#7
I click my heels and I'm there

B            C#7          E7
Underground, underground, ooh
Everything's happy underground
B                       C#7
You been kicked around
                   E7
Did life bring you down here
B    Bsus4/C#  B5/D#    B6/E  B5maj7/D#  Bsus4/C#  B     A
Ev - ery       thing's  hea - vy         un -      der - ground

Single notes: F#  A#  C#  D#  F#

We'll be decked in all black
Slamming the pit fantastic
Officer Friendly's little boy's got a mohawk
He knows just where we're coming from
It's industrial, work it underground
Get down, get down, get down

Underground, underground
Everything's happy underground
You been kicked around
Did life bring you down here
Everything's heavy underground
