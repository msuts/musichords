Underground by Ben Folds Five

[SLOW INTRO]
Abm

I was never cool in school
             Baug
I'm sure you don't remember me
    B6/F# 
And now it's been 10 years
          F#
I'm still wondering who to be
        B6
But I'd love to mix
   Baug/E                B5/D#       B6/F
In circles, cliques, and social coteries - that's me
                      B/F#  F#5-7  B/F#       F# 
Hand me my nose ring (Can   we     be    ha - ppy?)
                      B/E  C#m-no5/E  B/E        E
Show me the mosh pit (Can  we         be    ha - ppy?)
B  C#m7  B/D#  E  B/D#  C#m7  B     A
We can   be    ha-ppy   un -  der - ground

[FAST INTRO]
B  Baug  B6  Baug
B  Baug  B6  Baug

[VERSE 1]
B             Baug                 B6
Who's got the looks, who's got the brains
          B7         B/F#
Who's got everything
E7         D#7        G#m7          F#m7
I got this pain in my heart, that's all
E                Em7      A2-7   B
Hey you with the long and lonely face
        D7        E7        C#m7/F#
There's got to be something else

               B              Baug
Let me tell ya something else
               B6                 B7  B/F#
There was this girl who passed me by
           E7              D#7
She gave a smile but I was shy
         G#m7     F#m7
I looked down, so down
E                       Em7   Em7/A  A7    B
Don't look there no no, go go un -   der - ground
    D             E           C#m7/F#
But now there's a place to go

[PRE-CHORUS 1]
B                
It's the morning now
B7/A
It's the evening
     G#m7
It's everything
G7         F#7
I click my heels and I'm there

[CHORUS 1]
B            C#7          E7
Underground, underground, ooh
                             B       
Everything's heavy underground
                      C#7
You been kicked around
                     E7
Did life bring you down here
B     C#m7  B/D#     E     B/D#  C#m7  B     A
Eve - ry    thing's  hea - vy    un -  der - ground

Single notes: F#  A#  C#  D#  F#

[VERSE 2]
                   B        Baug                 
We'll be decked in all black
             B6           B7
Slamming the pit fantastic
    B/F#  E7                D#7         G#m7    
Officer   Friendly's little boy's got a mohawk
    F#m7                  E
He knows just where we're coming from
                 Em7     Em7/A  A7    B
It's industrial, work it un -   der - ground
        D         E       C#m7/F#
Get down, get down, get down

[CHORUS 2]
B            C#7          E7
Underground, underground, ooh
                             B       
Everything's heavy underground
                      C#7
You been kicked around
                     E7
Did life bring you down here
B     C#m7  B/D#     E     B/D#  C#m7  B     A
Eve - ry    thing's  hea - vy    un -  der - ground
We can be happy, we can be happy, we can be happy underground
