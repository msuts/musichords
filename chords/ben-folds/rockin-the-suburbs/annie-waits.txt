[INTRO]
C  G  F  C
C  G  F  C

[VERSE 1]
    C
And so
G  F  C                         C     G  F  C
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
    G/B  Am   G
For a    call
       D
From a friend
    C
The same
G    F   C
It's the same
                  C     G F C
Was it always the same?
   G/B  Am    G               
Annie   waits    for the last
C    G  F  C
Time
C    G  F  C
Oh

[VERSE 2]
    C      G   F   C                         C     G  F  C
The clock    never stops, never stops, never waits
          G/B  Am  G
She's growing  old
             D
It's getting late
    F        G
And so he forgot, he forgot
      Am
Maybe not
D                   F
Maybe he's been seriously hurt
G             C      G F C
Would that be worse?

[PRECHORUS 1]
Gm         Dm
Headlights crest the hill
F                C             Gm    Dm  F  C  Gm
Shadows pass her by and out of sight
Gm    Dm
Annie sees her dreams:
F             C              Gm    Bb6
Friday bingo, pigeons in the park

[CHORUS 1]
C     G     F       C         G  F  C
Annie waits for the last time
C        G    F      C        
Just the same as the last time
  G/B  Am        F           C              G   Am
Annie  says "You see this is why I'd rather be alone."

F  C  G

[VERSE 2]
    C
And so
G  F  C                         C     G F C
Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits
    G/B  Am   G
For a    call
       D
From a friend
    F
The same
         G
It's the same
                  Am    D
Was it always the same?
      F     G          C
Annie waits     as the last

[PRECHORUS 2]
Gm         Dm
Headlights crest the hill
F               C           Gm    Dm  F  C
Who will be the one forever more?
Gm     Dm
Annie, I could be
F                   C                 Gm   Bb6
If we're both still lonely when we're old

[CHORUS 2]
C     G     F       C         G  F  C
Annie waits for the last time
C        G    F      C         G  F  C      
Just the same as the last time
C     G     F       C         G  F  C
Annie waits for the last time
C        G    F      C        
Just the same as the last time
  G/B  Am    G
Annie  waits
            C
But not for me
