VERSE:
F#                              B
She broke down and cried at the strip mall acupuncturist 
                           F#
While the world went on outside
    F#
The Chinese doctor took her arm
      B                                                       F#
Gazed at the floor, and read her wrist for the secrets in her mind

CHORUS:
 G#m
"Here's your medicine," she said
        B                              F#
"If you not smile at him, then someone else will" 
G#m                       
You hold that thought
    B                      F#
And I'll hold that thought too
C#    B     F#
Ooooooh - ooooh
C#    B     A     G
Ooooooh - ooooh

VERSE:
F#                 B
I was shown the 36 ways I'm not available 
                 F#
On a simple easy chart
F#                           B
Later on that evening on the beach in Santa Monica 
                    F#
It was a very risky start 

CHORUS:
   G#m
Suppose this stupid chart is right  
B                                 F#
In a year will you still feel the same way? 
      G#m                       
Well, you hold that thought
    B                      F#
And I'll hold that thought too
C#    B     F#
Ooooooh - ooooh
C#    B     A     G
Ooooooh - ooooh

VERSE:
                                  B
Did you ever see the film where a man who's given spectacles 
                         F#
That make the world look upside down?
   F#                            B
He falls about the place, but in time he somehow readjusts 
    G#m
And when they take the glasses off 
    B                              F#
The eyes he's always had see sky below him and he falls again 

CHORUS:
      G#m                       
Well, you hold that thought
    B                     
And I'll hold that thought
G#m                       
You hold that thought
    B                     
And I'll hold that thought
G#m                       
You hold that thought
    B                     
And I'll hold that thought
