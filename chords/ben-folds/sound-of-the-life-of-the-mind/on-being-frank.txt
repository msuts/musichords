[VERSE 1]
  G          D/G     Am/G
I had it all,     or should I say I saw it all?
           Em                  Bm           Em            Bm
And it's a long way from the dustbin of New Jersey to the top
               Am      Fmaj7
Who would have known?
               Dsus4  D
Who would have known

  G           D/G     Am/G
I had a dream,    but dreams had other plans for me
       Em              Bm
For 30 years I set the thermostat
      Em            Bm
Where Frank Sinatra liked it,
           Am                 Em
Pulled his girls and hung his hats
        Am                   Em
I never knew which ones were mine
         Bm            D      D7
Now he's gone, and I'm alone

[CHORUS 1]
      G     
And I don't know where I might be going
  Bm
I heard the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Am
Set me on the roadside coming home
    D         Em            C                D
But home, for me was always someone else you know
     Em             C              D
That shadows always fall, when the sun goes down

[VERSE 2]
  G               D/G   Am/G  
I shook the hands,      mafia dons and presidents
                Em             Bm
And though they always smile politely
       Em         Bm
With a measure of decorum
            Am                Em
Still their eyes would scan beyond me
      Am                   Em
For a glimpse of something more
             Bm
But now he's gone,
            D     D7
Now they're gone

[CHORUS 2]
      G     
And I don't know where I might be going
  Bm
I heard the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Am
Set me on the roadside coming home
    D         Em            C                D
But home, for me was always someone else you know
     Em             C              D
That shadows always fall, when the sun goes down

[BRIDGE]
D          Em          C               D
Alone, the shadow of a star, don't you know
     Em             C          D
That shadows always fall, yeah shadows always fall,

When the sun goes down

[CHORUS 3]
      G     
And I don't know where I might be going
  Bm
I heard the wind, the wind stopped blowing
Am
Set me on the roadside coming home
    D         Em            C                D
And home, for me was always someone else you know
