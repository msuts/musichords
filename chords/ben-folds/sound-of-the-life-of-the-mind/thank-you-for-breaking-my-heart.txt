VERSE:
        Gsus2/F  Gsus2             Gsus4/E  Gsus4
Yeah, I want           a different ans - wer
      Gsus2/F  Gsus2           Gsus4/E  Gsus4
So, I ask             you once again
        G/D     G-no5     Em   G-no5       
But the truth's in    the si - lence
    Am          Am7/F  Am7
And this time I got    it
     Gm7/Eb  /F    /G   /A  /Bb  /C
It's o           - ver

CHORUS:
G/D           Am/D     Bm7/D  Am/D   [SINGLE NOTES: A D A G F# D E G F# D B G F# D]
Thank you for breaking my     heart
Bm7/D  Am/D 
Now I  know that it's in there
  F/A          C/G      Ebdim7       G/D
I left it wide open and asked you to stay
    C        Bm
But you know better

[INTRO REPEAT]
        Gsus2/F  Gsus2              Gsus4/E  E  [BASS: C]
Guess I thought         it wouldn't happen
            Gsus2/F  Gsus2           Gsus4/E  E  [BASS: C]
And I could care            until it hurt
         G/D   G-no5  Em    G-no5
Damn the i   - ronic  tim - ing, 
    Am           LOW Am7   Am7/F
The clouds and their lin - ing
     Gm7/Eb  /F  /G  /A  /Bb  /C
That o -     pen up  and pour

CHORUS:
    G/D           Am/D     Bm7/D  Am/D   [SINGLE NOTES: A D A G F# D E G F# D B G F# D]
And thank you for breaking my     heart
Bm7/D  Am/D 
Now I  know that it's in there
       f/a        C/G       Ebdim7         G/D
What a fool to imagine that you'd feel the same
    C2       Bm
But you know better

BRIDGE:
Em/G                Bm/F#
Rain has washed the leaves away
C/G     Am7      Bm/F#  Bm-no5
Skele - tons and stars
    F/A                  F/G  F
I'm pulling the door too
    C/E         C
And closing the blinds

CHORUS/OUTRO:
   G/D           Am/D     Bm7/D  Am/D   [SINGLE NOTES: A D A G F# D E G F# D B G F# D]
So thank you for breaking my     heart
Bm7/D  Am/D 
Now  I know what it feels like
       C        Bm [SINGLE NOTES: A B G A F# G E F# D E C B]
And it hurts so bad
        C         Bm [SINGLE NOTES: A B G A F# G E F# D E C B]
Tell me this will pass
         C         Bm    D
Soon and I'll know bet - ter
