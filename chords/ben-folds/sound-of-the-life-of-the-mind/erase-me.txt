[VERSE 1]
Ebm9         Gm6
What was our home
Ebm9      Gm6
Paper not stone
Ebm9         Gm6
A lean-to at most
             Dm7         Cm         Cm/D
And when you pulled your half away

Ebm9    Gm6
Gravity won
Ebm9           Gm6
Like it always does
Ebm9          Gm6
Did I weigh a ton?
            Dm9       Cm
Would it be easier to just delete
    Gm                     D7
Our pages and the plans we made?

[CHORUS 1]
 Gm
Erase me
             Bbm
So you don't have to face me
F/A                      Am
Put me in the ground and mow the daisies
Cm         Ebm     Ebm/F
   Ah, the memory
Gm         D    D/C  D/Bb  D/A
See how it goes
Gm

Gm  Gm/A  Gm/Bb  Gm/C  D

[VERSE 2]
Ebm9             Gm6
So what will you do
Ebm9           Gm6
With no me for you?
Ebm9           Gm6
I know what we said
              Dm7    Cm
But what if I left a thing or two
   Bbmaj7
We know that you don't seem
   D/A
To think about what you need
         D/C                D7
'til you reach to find that you've

[CHORUS 2]

Erased me
                 Bbm
What the fuck is this?
              F/A              
You're crazy, turned around
             Am
In two weeks time replaced me
Cm         Ebm    Ebm/F
   Ah, the memory
Gm                     D7
Everybody knows how it goes, you just

 Gm
Erase me
              Bbm
Did me like a bro and tazed me
F/A                     Am
Fireworks - poof - it's gone, amazing
Cm          Ebm           Ebm/F
   New bio, you've gone solo
Gm                       D7             D/C  D/Bb  D/A
Drawing mustaches on our wedding photo


Gm  Gm/A  Gm/Bb  Gm/C  D

Cm         Ebm    Ebm/F
   Ah, the memory
