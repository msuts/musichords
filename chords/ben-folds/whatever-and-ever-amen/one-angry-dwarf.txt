If you really want to see me check the papers and the TV
G                              F#7sus4  F#7
Look who's telling who what to do
              
Yeah, kiss my ass, goodbye

[repeat intro]

Don't give me that bullshit, you know who I am
I'm your nightmare, little man
Vic, you stole my lunch money, made me cry
Jane, remember second grade?
Said, you couldn't stand my face
Rather than kiss me you said here I die

I'm big and important
One angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces are you
If you really want to see me check the papers and the TV
Look who's telling who what to do
Yeah, kiss my ass goodbye

You'll be sorry one day, yeah, you will, yes, you will
You shouldn't push me around 'cause I will, yes, I will
You will be sorry when I'm big, yes, you will, yes, you will
You will be sorry

'Cause I'm big and important
One angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces are you
If you really want to see me check the papers, check the TV
Oh, no, look who's telling who what to do
Kiss my ass
