[[Note: Some of these chords are really textured and complicated especially if you're looking to use these on guitar. If a chord needs to be played a certain way, it is notated at the bottom of the file. If these chords are too hard to use, I will be releasing a simplified transcription alongside this one which will be less accurate but easier to read.]]

PIANO SOLO pt 2:
[This part is too cool to just give basic chords, so here's a breakdown of what each hand does, in individual notes. Use Notepad and turn off Word Wrap and make the window full screen if the formatting is bad. Follow the recording and this should hopefully make sense. Dashes represent 6/8 beats counted in 6, equals signs indicate 16th notes. Lower case t indicates triplet figure.]

----- NOTES -----
* "F5" and "G5" as written here is voiced inverted using using C-F or D-G above middle C.

** Gsus4-7/D is voiced with a D as the root and the following notes above it: G-C-D-F.

*** When playing the F/C, Ben often uses Ab as a grace note to the A in the F chord. Listen to the recording to get the idea of what he's doing, it's just a simple grace note. The high D in the solo also uses a C# grace note.

**** These chords are played with single note or octaves in the bass, and without the fifth of the triad (ex. D is D-F#, Em is E-G).

***** Do not play the G# (the third) of the triad, this is a very short and smooth transition chord to the Dm.
