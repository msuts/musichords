[VERSE 1]
Dm                    C         F    C/E
From the back of your big brown eyes
Dm              C       F    Bb     C
I knew you'd be gone as soon as you could
F     Bb        C
And I hoped you would
Dm                    C       F
We could see that you weren't yourself
Dm                    C        F
And the lines on your face did tell
     Bb      C
It's just as well
      F/A   Bb     C     F      D7
You'd never be yourself again

[CHORUS 1]
             Gm
Saw you last night
             C            F/A   Bb
Dance by the light of the moon
              Gm
Stars in your eyes
              C             Dm
Free from the life that you knew

[BRIDGE]
Dm                    C         F      Bb       C
You're the magic that holds the sky up from the ground
Dm                     C           F          Bb    C
You're the breath that blows these cool winds 'round
Dm             C       F     Bb  C
Trading places with an angel now

Dm    D7

Stars in your eyes

Free from the life that you knew
             Gm
Saw you last night
              C
Stars in your eyes
             F
Smiled in my room
