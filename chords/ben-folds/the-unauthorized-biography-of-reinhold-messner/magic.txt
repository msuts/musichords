Dm                    C         F    C/E
From the back of your big brown eyes
Dm              C       F    Bb     C
I knew you'd be gone as soon as you could
F     Bb        C
And I hoped you would
Dm                    C       F
We could see that you weren't yourself
Dm                    C        F
And the lines on your face did tell
     Bb      C
It's just as well
      F/A   Bb     C     F      D7
You'd never be yourself again

Dance by the light of the moon

Stars in your eyes

Free from the life that you knew

You're the magic that holds the sky up from the ground
Dm                     C           F          Bb    C
You're the breath that blows these cool winds 'round
Dm             C       F     Bb  C
Trading places with an angel now

Smiled in my room
