Ab7               Fm7/Ab
Lying awake in my hospital room
Ab-#5**                    Fm7/Ab
Silas Creek Parkway is my only view
        Dbm9
And the doctor just came by and told me the news
                Ab7
I need a second opinion
Fm7                       Ebm9
I don't believe that it's true

Bbm9  Dbmaj7
