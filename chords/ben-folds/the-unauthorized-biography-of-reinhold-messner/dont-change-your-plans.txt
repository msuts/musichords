[INTRO]
A F#m7 G E
A F#m7 G E

[VERSE 1]
    A               F#m7
Sometimes I get the feeling
       G                E
That I won't be on this planet
    F         C  G/B
For very long
A        F#m7
I really like it here
G           E
I'm quite attached to it
  F              C  G/B
I hope I'm wrong

A     F#m7   G         E
All I really wanna say
A             F#m7   G       E
Is you're the reason I wanna stay
A                    F#m7
I loved you before I met you
      G               E
And I met you just in time
                 F            G
'Cause there was nothing left

[VERSE 2]
  A              F#m7
I sat here on my suitcase
       G         E
In our empty new apartment
          F             C  G/B
Until the sun went down
       A                    F#m7
Then I walked back down the stairs 
            G              E
With all my bags and drove away
            F            C  G/B
You must be freaking out

A     F#m7         G        E
All I know is I've gotta be
A        F#m7       G        E
Where my heart says I oughta be
   A              F#m7
It often makes no sense, in fact
  G          E                  F      G
I never understand these things I feel

[CHORUS 1]
A/C#   Dm     G/B  C         F   Dm  G
Don't  change your plans for me
A/C#  Dm    G/B   C   F 
I     won't move  to  LA
A/C#  Dm     G/B  C       F
The   leaves are  falling back east
       F         G     Am
That's where I'm gonna stay

You have made me smile again
In fact, I might be sore from it
It's been a while
I know we've been together many times before
I'll see you on the other side

Don't change your plans for me
I won't move to LA
The leaves are falling back east
That's where I'm going to stay

All I really wanna say
Is you're the reason I wanna stay
But destiny is calling and won't hold
And when my time is up I'm outta here

All I know is I gotta be
Where my heart says I oughta be
It often makes no sense, in fact
I never understand these things I feel

I love you, good bye
I love you, good bye
