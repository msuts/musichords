PADDLEBOAT BREAKUP by BEN FOLDS
from the album WHAT MATTERS MOST (2023)

[ACAPELLA INTRO]
N.C.
Tossed about the ocean
N.C.
In boats built for a lake
N.C.
Life is but a dream
N.C.
A stream of beautiful mistakes

[INSTRUMENTAL INTRO]

[VERSE 1]
C
On a quiet lake
C
So far from the shore
C
We had paddled for an hour
C
Back would be way more

C
She said that's just great, oh
C
What is wrong with you?
C
You wait 'til we're trapped in a boat
C
To tell me we're through

[CHORUS 1]
Dm
  (By then the safe is dark??)
C
  It had seemed so clear
Dm
  Tell the truth and let the daylight shine
          C
Watch the shadows disappear
Dm
  And then the morning came
Fm6
  And I couldn't bring myself to say it

[VERSE 2]
C
So we went through all seasons
C
Wrapped in safety vests
C
The bright red sun it seared my soul
C
Her eyes, they burned the rest

C
You must really hate me
C
To have planned it out like this
C
You can't get us back to the shore
C
I'm not rowing shit

[CHORUS 2]
Dm
  And then the questions came
C
  With no place to hide
Dm
  Why did I blurt it trapped alone in a boat?
  C
I rowed against the tide
Dm
  I guess I had all day
Fm6
  But I couldn't bring myself to say it

[VERSE 3]
C
So we turned in our vests
C
And headed to our cars
C
She said bye and drove away
C
But mine, it would not start

    F
And now the sun is setting
    G7
And everyone has left
    Am
I'm waiting for the tow truck now
    C
And she just sent a text

[CHORUS 3]
          Dm
She said "You see these last few days
C
  I've had something big to say
Dm
  How romantic it would be to wait
          C
And I can tell you on the lake
Dm
  But then you dropped that bomb
Fm6
  And I couldn't bring myself to say it"
