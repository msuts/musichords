MOMENTS by BEN FOLDS
from the album WHAT MATTERS MOST (2023)

[INTRO]
G2

[VERSE 1]
G2                               Am7
  Let's tell ourselves that it's great to be alive
      Bm7              Am7         C/D  D7
Let's take our time to open up our eyes
G2                           Am7
  We mumble words that sound meaningless
     Bm7          Am7       C/D  D7
When meaning is impossible to find

   Bm7               Cmaj9
We try to hold these moments as they glow
      Bm7
We'll breathe them in
    Cmaj9            C/D  D7
And then we'll let them go

[CHORUS 1]
G2                        Am7
 And so I ask you to bear witness to this crime
   Bm7
Of letting my heart shine
    Cmaj9       C/D   D7
I'm ready to surren - der

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]
G2

[VERSE 2]
G2                               Am7
 Let's take those signs like the lonely hummingbird
     Bm7
That (hummed??) right by
  Am7              C/D  D7
I hummed alone (unsure??)
      G2                    Am7
These stormy skies won't be dark enough
            Bm7                     Am7     C/D  D7
To throw me off when everything's (aligned??)

    Bm7
The sand in the face
    Cmaj9
The dull and quiet pain
         Bm7                   Cmaj9
That for now seems so far away
                C/D  D7
It seems so far away

[CHORUS 2]
G2                        Am7
 And so I ask you to bear witness to this crime
   Bm7
Of letting my heart shine
    Cmaj9       C/D    D7
I'm ready to surren - der

[BRIDGE]
Bm7          Cmaj9   
   We try to hold
Bm7              Cmaj9
   These moments as they glow
Bm7                   Cmaj9
   We'll breathe them in
    C/D  D7   Am7
And then we'll
      Bm7   Am7
Let them go___
      Bm7    C/D  D7
Let them go___

[VERSE 3]
G2                       Am7
 And now we lie together face up to the stars
    Bm7
I'm letting my heart shine
  Cmaj9           C/D    D7   G
I think I just surren - dered
