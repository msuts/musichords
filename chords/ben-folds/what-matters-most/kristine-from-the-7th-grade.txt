Cm                      Cm/Bb
  Are you the same Kristine
Abmaj7
  I knew from seventh grade?
Bbsus4     Bb/Ab
  No, it's definitely you
Eb            G7b9
  Just with a new last name

Cm                      Cm/Bb
  Someone who laughed a lot
Abmaj7
  Is what I remember the most
Bbsus4               Bb/Ab
  But the face in your profile
Eb                           G7b9
  Suggests maybe not so much anymore

[PRE-REFRAIN 1]
Fm
  Yeah, I got the emails
Cm
  These last two years every day
Fm                   Bb
  And I just don't reply because
        Cm                  Cm/Bb
I'm not really sure what to say

[VERSE 2]
Cm                    Cm/Bb
   The anger, the all caps
Abmaj7
   And all thе pseudoscience
Bbsus4                    Bb/Ab
   The misspellings, they must be on purpose
   Eb                          G7b9
We went to a good school, Kristine

Cm                           Cm/Bb
   So what would you imagine I might
Abmaj7
   Take from this deluge of memes
Bbsus4               Bb/Ab
   The cryptic, dark Bible quotes
         Eb
Guns and dead fetuses
           G7b9
Seriously, Kristine, are you okay?

[PRE-REFRAIN 2]
Fm                      Bb7
  'Cause this world can be
Ebmaj9    Abmaj7      Gm

[VERSE 3]
Cm                          Cm9
There's a break in the rain
Abmaj7
      A perfect time for a walk
Bbsus4
     The smell of wet leaves
         Bb/Ab
And warm smiles and hellos
Eb                          G7b9
  These things exist in the real world, you know

Cm                      Cm/Bb
  Oh, what a shame, Kristine
Abmaj7
  This disease that makes strangers of friends
Bbsus4                          Bb/Ab
  But if these days it's really usses and thems
      Eb                             G7b9
Maybe you should just take me off of both of those lists

[OUTRO]
Fm                   Bb7       Ebmaj9
  'Cause it's such a short and sad
    Abmaj7         Gm
And beautiful life
Fm             Bb
   Do you ever see it that way?
