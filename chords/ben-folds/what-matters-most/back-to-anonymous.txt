[VERSE 1]
D7
These days
                         Am7              G/A  Am7
It doesn't matter, I can let myself go
              Gmaj7             Am7/G  Gmaj7
No disguises, go for a stroll
                   Cmaj7  Gmaj7/C  Cmaj7
It's back to anonymous

      D7              Am7/D  D7
But those years were
                           Am7               G/A  Am7
One big blur, I'm not sure where I have been
                   Gmaj7
I dream the pieces back now and then
  Cmaj7  Gmaj7/C  Cmaj7
Mmm

[CHORUS 1]
      Amj7   B7
Is it  cli - che
        Em7        D/E
Does it sound so ungrateful
        Am7   B7   Em7      D/E
When it comes out that way?
Am7   B7         Em7  G/D  A7
   If so, I only mean to   say
Am7                   D7
   Thank you for those   crazy days
                      Cmaj7  Gmaj7/C  Cmaj7
Now it's back to anonymous

[VERSE 2]
D7         Am7/D  D7
Strangers
                            Am7                G/A  Am7
Creepy and comfortable that they knew my name
                     Gmaj7                         Am7/G  Gmaj7
It's not at all what I thought that fame would be
                    Cmaj7  Gmaj7/C
It was just a small world
      Cmaj7
For a while

       D7             Am7/D  D7
Is life   better now?
                              Am7               G/A  Am7
Well, that depends on how I'm feeling about it
                      Gmaj7         Am/G  Gmaj7
It's not so much that I wanted out
                  Cmaj7        Gmaj7/C  Cmaj7
I really didn't have     a say

[CHORUS 1]
           Am7  B7
But it's a big  world
     Em7       D/E        
With un-famous people
       Am7       B7    Em7     D/E
Who deserve the grand applause
Am7         B7            Em7  D/E
   And they quietly carry on
Am7            B7                 Em7  G/D   A7
   I'd like to think that I could be   that  strong
Am7                   D7
   Daydreaming on the bus, that's all
                 Cmaj7     Gmaj7/C  Cmaj7
Now it's back to anonymous

[VERSE 3]
    D7
The wife and I feeding the birds, in love
   Am7                  G/A  Am7
In comfortable clothes
                          Gmaj7
The neighbors, they don't wink like they know

[CHORUS]
              Am7        B7    
But back when     they'd say
Em7        D/E
Savor this moment
       Am7  
It's your time
B7        Em7   D/E
Seize the day
Am7      B7             Em7   D/E
   But I couldn't stay awake
Am7      B7            Em7   D/E
   And I didn't feel a thing
Am7          B7              Em7   G/D  A7
   And she reminds me when I start to   think
Am7                          D7
   I might throw my hat back    in the ring
                 D7
But it's time to be
