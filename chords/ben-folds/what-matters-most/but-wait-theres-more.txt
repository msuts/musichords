Wait
        Eb7
There's more

Wait
        Eb7
There’s more

[VERSE 1]
Dbmaj9
Wait, there's more
                  Eb7
What used to be extreme's now a bore
                       Dbmaj9
That freak show in the landscaping parking lot
                Eb7
Was oh-so-funny then, now it’s not (Enough)

[VERSE 2]
    Dbmaj9
But wait, there's more
                         Eb7
Did we really think we'd go  back to normal?
                   Dbmaj9
Did we really ever think we could cut that cord
                         Eb7
'Cause look who's coming back, coming back for more

More, more, more

Do you still believe in the good of humankind

(Wait)        Time that you won't get back
         Eb7
(There's more) All the places you'll never be 
Dbmaj9
(Wait) Books that you might have read 
         Eb7
(There's more) And mobs you can’t unsee

[CHORUS 2]
                  Abmaj9
But wait, there’s more

More, more, more

But wait, there's more

Not sure that we can take too much more
                    Dbmaj9
Pray that there’s a bottom somewhere in sight
             Eb7
Brothers and sisters, hold tight
