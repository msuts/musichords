[INTRO]
F  Gm7  Am7  Gm7

[VERSE 1]
F           Gm7   Am7              Gm7
You're only sorry    when you've been called out
F              Gm7               Am7       Dsus4  D7
  I'm suddenly sane when I stand my ground
G                   C            F                  Bb
  And you have made  such a mess  with no worry, no thought
Eb      Bb            Gm                     Csus4  C
  Here come the tears   now that you've been caught

[VERSE 2]
F             Gm7       Am7              Gm7
 Afraid to confront you    when you're so    child-like
F            Gm7               Am7       Dsus4  D7
 You pull no   punches and I absorb them
G               C            F                     Bb
 Just when I've  had enough,   just before I might    crack
Eb            Bb        Gm                     C        A/C#
  You make me smile and    I take all of those thoughts back

[CHORUS 1]
Dm              F             Bb    C/Bb   Bb
   Something so fragile about you
Dm            F               Bb
   It's how you get away with what you do
          G7     C/G   G7
It's like crash, boom, oops
      Bb    C/Bb  Bbmaj7
Did I break that  too?
          F
And I almost believe you

[ORCHESTRAL BREAK]
F  Gm7  Am7  Gm7
F  Gm7  Am7  Dsus4  D7

[VERSE 3]
G                C             F                      Bb
 And just when I'd had enough,  and I thought I might   leave
Eb            Bb        Gm                  C  A/C#
  Rather than hurt you,    I'd let you hurt me

[CHORUS 2]
Dm              F             Bb    C/Bb   Bb
   Something so fragile about you
Dm            F               Bb
   It's how you get away with what you do
                 Am      Dm
It's like you're someone else
         Am       Dm
And when you come to
     Bb        F/A
Your eyes well up
            Gm    Am7  Bbmaj7
Oops, did I break that too?
          F
And I almost believe you

[ORCHESTRAL BREAK]
F  Gm7  Am7  Gm7
F  Gm7  Am7  A7

[OUTRO]
Dm              F             Bb    C/Bb   Bb
   Something so fragile about you
Dm                     F                       Bb
   It's like I blacked out for a year and woke up with you
          G7     C/G   G7
It's like crash, boom, oops
      Bb    C/Bb  Bbmaj7
Did I break that  too?
