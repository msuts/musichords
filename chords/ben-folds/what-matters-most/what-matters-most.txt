[VERSE 1]
C F/G   C           F/G  C  F/G  C       G/B  Am
I could not see the haze         back in the  day
F/E  Am         F/E  Am    F/E  Am
When we lived inside of it
    C/G  F        G
Now I'm  floating away
        Am   G/B  C     F/G  C     F/G  C  F/G
And haunting the  halls      night and  day
C           Em                 Em/B  Em          Em/B  Em
Out in some storage space out  on    the highway
   Em/B  F               G     C/G  G  C/G  G  C/G
Fifteen  years tossed in boxes

[CHORUS 1]
                F      G       E/G#         Am
Topped with old bills, phones, pictures and trash
        Bb         F        Em
All the dramas and memories attached
        F
Now I'm wondering
F/G          C
What matters most?

A true     friend   is      someone who 
Am  F/A  Am          F/A  Am       F/A  Am
When         you are with     them
    C/G  F            G
You know what matters most
             Am   G/B      C
Oh, but that door slams so tight
             Am  Em
With you and our time trapped behind it
           F        G
Now you're floating away

[CHORUS 2]
             F    G  E/G#         Am
But in these days of overwhelming change
  Bb           F           Em
I just want to know what I want
        F      G       E/G#        Am
Becausе I only seem to know what I don't
        F
With so little time
F/G          C
What matters most?
    Am
Mmmmmm
     C/G  F
Tеll me   what
F/G          C
What matters most?
    Am
Mmmmmm

[VERSE 3]
                     C     F/G  C
I keep going for the phone
F/G  C          F/G  C       G/B  Am   F/A  Am  F/A  Am
To   send you a note    with the  news
             F/A  Am             F
And I'm thinking "man, you won't believe this"
G        C    F/G  C  F/G  C
  You're gone

[CHORUS 3/OUTRO]
C               F              G          E/G#      Am
Sorting through photos of fake smiles and photos of real ones
        Bb                 F          Em
Now I'm throwing the whole lot in the bin
           F
Just got a glimpse
   F/G          C
Of what matters most
G/B  Am
Mmmmmmmmmm
     C/G  F
Tell me   what
F/G          C
What matters most?
G/B  Am
Mmmmmmmmm
Bb  F/A  Gm  G
