[VERSE 1]
G        D       Am           D
Fits and starts, clouds and ellipses
G      D         Am      D
I fill silences with the dark
    Em        Bm
And I,  I can take it
D         Am       C
I want to know the uncensored thoughts
D7sus4
Or maybe not

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]
G  D  Am  D
G  D  Am  D

[VERSE 2]
G      D   Am          D
I know you    and your rhythm
     G           D
When you took an extra beat
Am       D
   That rang true
      Em       Bm         D              Am
Were you being honest and thought better of it
C                       D7sus4
I watched the cloud hesitate then nothing

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]
G  D  Am  D

[CHORUS 1]
G             D
Clouds with ellipses
     Am              D
They come and go and come and go
    G       D   Am  D
And   fade away
G             D
Clouds with ellipses
     Am              D
They come and go and come and go
    G       D   Am  D
And   fade away

[BRIDGE 1]
Eb          Bb/D     F/C          Bb
  For these moments, nothing else mattеrs
Eb        F            G
  I found doldrums and pain
Eb         Bb/D  F/C        Bb  
  We float free     til the cloud bursts
    Am2
Are you еven real?
        C                   D7sus4
Is that what you started to tell me but couldn't?

G  D  Am  D

[CHORUS 2]
G             D
Clouds with ellipses
     Am              D
They come and go and come and go
    G       D   Am  D
And   fade away
G             D
Clouds with ellipses
     Am              D
They come and go and come and go

[BRIDGE 2]
Eb      Bb/D      F/C       Bb
  Meet me    here, free and numinous
Eb        F            G
  Soaring over the rain
Eb           Bb/D        F/C          Bb  
We've got to be our most    beautiful versions
  Am
Until we come down
        C
Someone else gets the real thing
    D7sus4                 G  D         Am  D
And we get our dots and our      clouds 

[CHORUS 3/OUTRO]
G             D
Clouds with ellipses
     Am              D
They come and go and come and go
    G       D   Am  D
And   fade away
G             D
Clouds with ellipses
     Am              D
They come and go and come and go
    G       D   Am  D
And   fade away
G             D
Clouds with ellipses
     Am              D
They come and go and come and go
