[VERSE 1]
A        Asus2   D2/A
  Ten minutes in Winslow Gardens
A          Asus2    D2/A
  Never noticed the views or the walls
C#m7                  Dmaj7
  The whole world was closing
C#m7           D   D/E                 A      Asus2  D2/A
  We just took the keys and signed the line

[VERSE 2]
A           Asus2  D2/A
  Old folks in the windows watching
A            Asus2    D2/A
  Rolling in with our rain-soaked bags
C#m7               Dmaj7
  We'd packed in a rush back home
C#m7                  D     D/E           A     Asus2  D2/A  E/G#
  When always leaving meant always coming back

[CHORUS 1]
F#m7  F#m7/B  Fdim7/C  C#m7
Oh 
E               A  F#7/A#  Bm
Some trips just go         one way
Dmaj7  D/E  D/F#  A  F#m7  A/E
Oh
E                   Dmaj7
Just when plans are made
                C/D         D/E   A
You find you've started all over again

[VERSE 3]
A     Asus2    D2/A
  Ten weeks in Winslow Gardens
A           Asus2   D2/A
  Aired out and the mold is gone
C#m7            Dmaj7
  Back home the toll grows higher
C#m7           D  D/E           A           Asus2  D2/A
It's hard to reconcile with the bluer skies

[CHORUS 2]
F#m7  F#m7/B  Fdim7/C  C#m7
Oh 
E               A  F#7/A#  Bm
Some trips just go         one way
Dmaj7  D/E  D/F#  A
Oh
E                      Dmaj7
Just when it seemed so safe
   C/D         D/E   Fmaj7
It started all over again

[BRIDGE]
                    Cmaj7
Far away across the ocean
Fmaj7                   Em9    Em9/B  Em9/F#
   A small crowd and an auct - ion -  eer
Bbmaj7                      D/A       E/G#      E
   They're picking over the pieces of our lives
C/D
   But in this tiny apartment
D/E
   Sleeping like the dead through the night

[VERSE 4]
A     Asus2    D2/A
  Ten years in Winslow Gardens
A       Asus2        D2/A
A young couple moved in down the hall
C#m7                  Dmaj7
  In the window we're watching the rain
C#m7           D      D/E                 A    Asus2  D2/A
Strip the last of the leaves for an early fall

[CHORUS 3]
F#m7  F#m7/B  Fdim7/C  C#m7
Oh 
E               A  F#7/A#  Bm
Some trips just go         one way
Dmaj7  D/E  D/F#  A  F#m7  A/E
Oh
E                   Dmaj7
Just when plans are made
       C/D         D/E 
You've started all over
       C/D         D/E  A      Asus2  D2sus4/A
You've started all over again

A           Gmaj7/A
Ten minutes
