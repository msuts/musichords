I'm Not the Man by Ben Folds
From the album So There

VERSE:
               D                           
What will they write about me
              A               G      D/G      A     
What will the version be when all is said and done
          D        Bm                F#m
Will they remember all of the places seen
    A                 G      D/G       A
The poem's lost or am I just wandering on
G        D         A
I'm just wandering on

CHORUS:
               G          Em
There could be fewer days ahead than gone
Bm           A 
And all I've been 
    G
I'm long since on my way
            Em                Bm      A
To learning nothing comes for free
                Em   D
But I'm not the man
            G    A
I'm not the man
          G  Em  Bm  A
I used to be

VERSE:
      D                    Bm
So it all comes out in the wash
               F#m
What would you see? 
A                      G           D               A
Tattered pages and the ink stained pockets of your jeans
                Bm                     A
So I've come to pay my respects at the wake
     F#m                   G          D      A
I've buried it all and I'm dancing on my own grave
         G          D      A
Yeah I'm dancing on my own grave

CHORUS:
               G          Em
There could be fewer days ahead than gone
Bm           A 
And all I've been 
    G
I'm long since on my way
            Em                Bm      A
To learning nothing comes for free
                Em   D
But I'm not the man
            G    A
I'm not the man
          D   A/C#  Bm  A
I used to be

BRIDGE:
G     A          Bm    A
Don't leave me behind
G     A          Bm    A
Don't leave me behind
                G
Like I left you behind

CHORUS:
               G          Em
There could be fewer days ahead than gone
Bm           A 
And all I've been 
    G
I'm long since on my way
            Em                Bm      A
To learning nothing comes for free

        G              Em
I had a lot of time to waste
            Bm            A
I wrote the lines upon my face
        G        Em                Bm      A
Chasing down the shots they bought for me
                G    D/F#
But I'm not the man
            G    D/F#
I'm not the man
            G    A
I'm not the man
              G   Em  Bm  A
But I used to be

          G              Em
I used to be my father's son
          Bm        A
I used to be number one

          G            Em
I used to be paper and pencil
          Bm         A
I used to be endless potential

          G             Em
I used to be heaven and earth
          Bm        A
I used to be my net worth

          G                     Em
I used to be one public drunken moment
          Bm               A
I used to be high paid and low rent

          G             Em
I used to be a man on a mission
              Bm
My best chart position
               A
The man in the mirror

                   G
Your brother, your killer
             Em
A new day, a new town
		     Bm
Your racehorse, your cash cow
               A
Till I let you all down

              G   D/F#
Now I want to be
          G   A
I want to be
          D
Just want to be
