[VERSE 1]
F         Bb/F  Bbm/F
I'm not a fan
           Dm/F              Gm
But I understand if there is something
     C7/G         
That moves you
A7/G                       Fmaj7/A
      That's not my cup of tea
     G7/B                   C            F
It's part of what makes you beautiful to me

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]
F  Bb/F  F  Bb/F

[VERSE 2]
F         Bb/F  C/F
I'm not a fan
                  Dm
Like you and your friends
               Gm
You're so well read
                   C/G
I grew up on sugar cereal and TV
A7/C#                           F/C
I'm starting to wonder what you see in me
    G7/B              C             F
No, I'm not a fan but maybe I could learn to be

[BRIDGE]
Bbm                                   F
Oh, there's always something from the start
Bbm                                               F
You try to tell yourself it's only small but it's not
    F9/Eb
And it's the very thing that later on will tear it all apart

[VERSE 3]
F         Bb/F  Bbm/F
I'm not a fan
             Dm            Gm
And I wonder if you really are
           C/G
Or does it make you feel smart
  Gm                         C/G
A boy band with glasses just minus the heart
     Gm                  C
He's shaking his ass and you call it art
     A7/C#                 Dm
I'll wait in the lobby, go meet him for real
   A7/E                       Dm
We could all go to dinner and I'll be third wheel
   G
So go get your t-shirt signed
  C
