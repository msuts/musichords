from the album SO THERE (2015)

[VERSE 1]
Dm         G
   Take it easy
C       F
Take it slow
Dm      G
          Oh
C  C/D  C/E  F

Dm     G           C  
   Get on with the show
F                 Dm    G
Oh, that's what I know
C  C/D  C/E  F

Dm   G         C    F          
   I woke in a cold sweat 
        Dm  Dm/E  Dm/F  G
Last night
C  F
    
                  Dm           G
Seems what's been good for the music
       C              F            Dm    Dm/E  Dm/F  G
Hasn't always been so good for the life
C  F

[CHORUS 1]
               Dm         G
I've thrown my phone in a pool
   C     F
In New Orleans
          Dm         G
Found the love of my live
             C            F
Again, y'all knows what I means
            Dm           G
And I'll be back on your sofa
     C  C/D  C/E  F           Dm     G
In a puddle  in   a couple of weeks
        C  C/D  C/E  F
Oh yeah

[VERSE 2]
Dm    G          C           F
    I can't tell what you're saying
         Dm  Dm/E  Dm/F  G
When you yell 
       C  C/D  C/E  F
At the same         time

Dm           G                 C     F       Dm
   You could be telling me the story of your life
G        C     F
    Your life

         Dm          G
Is my malfunction so surprising
         C           F             Dm      G
'Cause I always seem so stable and bright
C  F

Dm           G          C  C/D  C/E  F
    Ain't it always the quiet        type

[CHORUS 2]
               Dm         G
I've thrown my phone in a pool
   C     F
In New Orleans
          Dm         G
Found the love of my live
             C            F
Again, y'all knows what I means
            Dm           G
And I'll be back on your sofa
     C  C/D  C/E  F           Dm
In a puddle  in   a couple of weeks
  G
I won't, I won't, I won't blame
      Dm
New Orleans

C  G  Dm
                 C              G      Dm     C  G  Dm
Can't you people function for a little while
                    C            G          Dm     C  G
Without me bouncing off the satellite for a night

C  F

[VERSE 3]
Dm          G
   Drink it fast or
C        F
Drink it slow
              Dm   G
That's what I know
C  F

Dm             G             C         F
   When you've gotten to the bottom of it
             Dm  F
It's time to go
C  C/D  C/E  F

                Dm          G
And when you've lived to be 200
     C         F          Dm   G
Feel free to offer your advice
C  F

      Dm    G
But until that time
          C      F
Here's my auto-reply

That's what I know
