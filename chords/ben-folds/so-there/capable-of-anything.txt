Some lyrics are incorrect since I had to transcribe them by ear

INTRO:
F  Am (x4)

VERSE:
F
What is this
           Am
It doesn't make much sense
                    Dm
They sing it like a pop song
       Bb
You're capable of anything
        F
And I'm sure they meant
             Am
You could be President
                  Dm           Bb
Or you could just forgive me

CHORUS:
    C         Gm
But I stopped caring what you think about me
C      Gm
I gave up
C                 Gm
We're told we are capable of anything
    Bb          Gm     C9/G               F  Am
But you don't seem to think that you are
           F         Am
Capable of anything

VERSE:
F
Swung and missed
         Am
I put my heart in this
              Dm
Mythical holy good guy
  Bb                          F
I want so bad to be but I was weak and wrong
           Am
And when I owned it all
   Dm
It only made you righteous 
        Bb
Now you get to blame your life on me

CHORUS:
    C         Gm
But I stopped caring what you think about me
C      Gm
I gave up
C                 Gm
We're told we are capable of anything    
    Bb          Gm     C9/G               F  Am
But you don't seem to think that you are
F          Am
Capable of anything

INSTRUMENTAL:
Em  Gm
Em  Gm
Bb

OUTRO:
    Fadd9   Am             Dm
You are_______  capable of anything
    Am        
But you don't seem to think 
     Bb
That you could fly so low
           Gm
Or sink so high
               Bb
That you could ever love again
        Gm
Or even try
               Bb                        Gm
That you could steal or cheat or kill or lie
               F  Am
But you might

F  Am
F
