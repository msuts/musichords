[VERSE 1]
G
Why didn't you tell me that I got fat?
        A/G
It's so easy, I can see it
Now I'm looking back
     C/G                             Gmaj7
As I empty one more round of smiling photographs

G
So many things you never mentioned to me
A/G
You didn't think I could listen
     C/G
Do I come across so weak?
             Gmaj7
I guess, sometimes I am

[CHORUS 1]
               A5    A5/B
Now, you're so gone   
C   C/D      
Oh
Eb             G/D           A2-5
I don't need a Yes Man and a song
A5/B  G
Oh,   why didn't you tell me about it?

[VERSE 2]
G
I watched a patch of morning light
      A/G
As it crept across a bed and
                       C/G
It reached your sleepy eyes
                        Gmaj7
And in that time I'd forgotten why

G
I couldn't tell you why I was mad
     A/G
So I held it in and you kept it back
      C/G
Every picture that I click and drag
     Gmaj7
It's obvious

[CHORUS 2]
              A5    A5/B
Now, we're so gone
C   C/D      
Oh
Eb             G/D           A2-5
I don't need a Yes Man and a song
A5/B  G
Oh,   why didn't you tell me about it?

[BRIDGE]
  A/G       C/G
I know, sometimes
    Gmaj7
You tried to talk to me
    Bb  /C     G/D
And I   make a joke of it
  A/C#        F/C
I do that sometimes
       Bb        F/A
When I know it's gonna hurt

[VERSE 3]
G
Why didn't you tell me that I got fat?
        A/G
Now I'm crying all the way from the photomat
         C/G
'Cause I see I got more chins
               G
Than a Chinese phone book has

[CHORUS 3]
               A5    A5/B
Now, you're so gone   
C   C/D      
Oh
Eb             G/D           G
I don't need a Yes Man and a song

    A/G                              C/G   G
Oh, why didn't you tell me about it?
    A/G                              C/G  Eb  Gadd9
Oh, why didn't you tell me about it?
