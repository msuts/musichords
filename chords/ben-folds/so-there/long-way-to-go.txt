Long Way to Go by Ben Folds
From the album "So There"

VERSE:
            Fmaj7
Yeah we got just five minutes
       Gsus4/E
We got just five minutes
         Dm         C
Till the man cuts a rope
            G
And we pull away

              Fmaj7
And there are no dry eyes
            Gsus4/E
Try to keep yours to mine
           Dm          C
There will be no guarantee
     G
Of return

PRECHORUS:
            Fmaj7
It might be running out
But look around
   Dm
We shut it down
         G         C
We had a hell of a run
C/E  F          Dm
Hold on to your hat
        G   Am/G  G
Here we go

CHORUS:
            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go

            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go
And the clock says, hey

G        F6
Do do do dodedo do dodedo do
G        F6
Do do do do

VERSE:
            Fmaj7
Yeah we got just three minutes
          Gsus4/E
Till this all turns to mist
        Dm          C
And the mist burns away
                 G
And you'll walk alone back  into the day

         Fmaj7
So let's drink up now
          Gsus4/E
Or we can pour the rest of it out
       Dm             C            G
Oh but don't let this moment slip away

PRECHORUS:
                F
Have we learned anything, anything
  Dm                   G               C
I gotta think maybe we learned when to hush
C/E  Fmaj7
Hold on
        Dm
Here we go

CHORUS:
            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go

            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go
And the clock says, hey

G        F6
Do do do dodedo do dodedo do
G        F6
Do do do do

BRIDGE/INSTRUMENTAL:
