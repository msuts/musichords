LONG WAY TO GO by BEN FOLDS
From the album SO THERE (2015)

[VERSE 1]
            Fmaj9
Yeah we got just five minutes
       Gsus4/E
We got just five minutes
         Dm         C
Till the man cuts a rope
            G
And we pull away
 
              Fmaj9
And there are no dry eyes
            Gsus4/E
Try to keep yours to mine
           Dm          C
There will be no guarantee
     G
Of return
 
[PRECHORUS 1]
            Fmaj9
It might be running out, but look around
   Dm
We shut it down
         G         C
We had a hell of a run
C/E  Fmaj9      Dm
Hold on to your hat
        G   Am/G  G
Here we go
 
[CHORUS 1]
            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go
 
            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go
                        G
And the clock says, hey
 
G        F6
Do do do dodedo do dodedo do
G        F6
Do do do do
 
[VERSE 2]
            Fmaj9
Yeah we got just three minutes
          Gsus4/E
Till this all turns to mist
        Dm          C
And the mist burns away
                 G
And you'll walk alone back  into the day
 
         Fmaj9
So let's drink up now
          Gsus4/E
Or we can pour the rest of it out
       Dm             C            G
Oh but don't let this moment slip away
 
[PRECHORUS 2]
                F
Have we learned anything, anything
  Dm                   G               C
I gotta think maybe we learned when to hush
C/E  Fmaj9
Hold on
        Dm
Here we go
 
[CHORUS 2]
            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go
 
            C
Long way to go
            C/E
Long way to go
     F
Long way to go
                        G
And the clock says, hey
 
G        F6
Do do do dodedo do dodedo do
G        F6
Do do do do
