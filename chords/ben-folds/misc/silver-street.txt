VERSE 1:
        F          Dm          Am7
Now the houses are ghosts over Silver Street
Dm              Dm/C            G/B     Gm/Bb  Am7  G
You've got them dressed up like clowns
        Gm7
Married couples slamming doors
     Am7          Faug/D  Cdim/D
Bums praising the lord
Gm7            Eb            F
You're playing tapes for the town

PRECHORUS:
        Am7
Now the neighborhood's mixed
                 A7-aug
And your college friends
Dm          F/C           G/B
Are getting younger every year

REFRAIN:
    Bbmaj7     Am7(no E)
The wind don't blow
        Ab(no E)    Gm7(no D)
And the grass don't grow
       Edim/F#(no B) Dmaj13 Db      Ebmaj7  Ebsus4  Gb6maj9  Gbmaj9  F
You're never leaving Silver Street

VERSE 2:
                F          Dm          Am7
You bought some brown wire frames at a junk shop
Dm            Dm/C         G/B     Gm/Bb  Am7  G
That was your trademark at school
            Gm7
Now they're barely hanging on
        Am7               Faug/D  Cdim/D
And the styles are moving on
Gm7        Eb          F
Hard for a man to stay cool

PRECHORUS:
        Am7
Now the seasons change
                    A7-aug
And the storefronts change
Dm         F/C            G/B
Everything else stays the same

REFRAIN:
    Bbmaj7     Am7(no E)
The wind don't blow
        Ab(no E)    Gm7(no D)
And the grass don't grow
       Edim/F#(no B) F             Bb/F  C/F  
You're never leaving Silver Street

Bridge:
        B
But now don't get me wrong
        Bbm
'Cause, oh I
Am7
Like this neighborhood
        Dm             D
Oh, and seeing you was good
        Dm           Dm/C#  F/C            G/B
But now we spent the day so completely uninspired
       Gm   Gm/A  Gm/Bb         Gm/B  C      Caug-roll
Asking why, oh    why,   should I be  tired?

VERSE 3:
                    F        Dm    Am7
They're filling the potholes in on Silver Street
Dm         Dm/C            G/B     Gm/Bb  Am7  G
Waking the neighbors up at noon
         Gm7
Now your friends are out on break
           Am7               Faug/D  Cdim/D
And you're out on your brown lawn
Gm7        Eb          F
Raking the dirt with a broom

PRECHORUS:
        Am7
Now the seasons change
                    A7-aug
And the storefronts change
Dm         F/C            G/B
Everything else stays the same

REFRAIN:
    Bbmaj7     Am7(no E)
The wind don't blow
        Ab(no E)    Gm7(no D)
And the grass don't grow
       Edim/F#(no B) Dmaj13 Db      Ebmaj7  Ebsus4  Gb6maj9  Gbmaj9  F
You're never leaving Silver Street

Ending:
Dbmaj13  Db    Ebmaj7  Ebsus4
Never leaving, never leaving
Dbmaj13  Db    Ebmaj7  Ebsus4
Never leaving, never leaving
Dbmaj13  Db    Ebmaj7  Ebsus4    F
Oh, oh, oh
