[VERSE 1]
Ab13sus4         Ab13       Ab13sus2        Db6add9      Dbadd9 
Mom      slammed the brakes and      nearly caused us to wreck
Ab13sus4               Ab13    Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9 
Then     she screeched a dirty word for  shock    effect
Bb7       Bb7sus4             Ebm7         Ebm7/Db   
Dad said, "gang, why don't we lock all the doors" 'cause
Gbmaj9                      Ab13
   Sherwood Forest never looked like this before

[VERSE 2]
Ab13sus4         Ab13  Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9 
Cars  piled from Donny Brook to  Lake     Club View
    Ab13sus4     Ab13  Ab13sus2   Db6add9   Dbadd9 
The animals were safe  and the    bums      were immune
Bb7      Bb7sus4    Bb7        Ebm7   Ebm7/Db   
I looked around the place when I came to and
Gbmaj9      Ab13         Dbadd9
   Sherwood Forest never looked so clear and

[CHORUS 1]
Ab13sus4  Ab13  Ab13sus2   Db6add9  Dbadd9
Ooooh,                     that's   all I knew
Ab13sus4     Ab13     Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9
Guess that I was in - nocent   too
Bb7                     Ebm7         Ebm7/Db
I'll sing a song and it won't be the blues

I don't miss Sherwood Forest

[VERSE 3]
Ab13sus4    Ab13        Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9 
Dad thought the problem was in    medical  care
Ab13sus4    Ab13        Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9 
Mom thought the problem was a     parking  fair
Bb7        Bb7sus4     Bb7     Ebm7        Ebm7/Db
   We made ourselves a promise out of thin air
    Gbmaj9    Ab13     Dbadd9
And called it Sherwood Forest

[CHORUS 2]
Ab13sus4  Ab13  Ab13sus2   Db6add9  Dbadd9
Ooooh,                     that's   all I know
Ab13sus4      Ab13   Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9
What we need, we get from the  sky
Bb7                  Ebm7      Ebm7/Db
Mom never cusses and dad never cries
    Gbmaj9  Ab13     Dbadd9
Now we left Sherwood Forest

Ab13sus4  Ab13  Ab13sus2   Db6add9  Dbadd9
Ooooh,                     that's   all I know

What we need, we get from the  sky
Bb7                  Ebm7      Ebm7/Db
Mom never cusses and dad never cries
    Gbmaj9  Ab13     Dbadd9
Now we left Sherwood Forest

[BRIDGE]
Ebm9                        Dbadd9              Gbmaj9
I vaguely remember you from when I was 10 years old
              Gbm7                     Dbadd9          Fm7/C
You dragged a bag of trash up and down Robin Hood Road
Bbm                         BbmMaj7   
    We used to call you the lady from Mars
Bbm7                         Bbm6           Cbmaj9
    You told us one day we'd all die in our cars

[VERSE 4]
Ab13sus4   Ab13      Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9
A thousand volts wouldn't      shock    me now
Ab13sus4    Ab13    Ab13sus2  Db6add9  Dbadd9
I used to only feel but I     feel     I know now
Bb7        Bb7sus4  Bb7       Ebm7        Ebm7/Db
Isn't this late to  find what life's all about
 Gbmaj9   Ab13     Dbadd9
Away from Sherwood Forest

[CHORUS 3]
Ab13sus4  Ab13  Ab13sus2   Db6add9  Dbadd9
Ooooh,                     I never  knew
Ab13sus4     Ab13   Ab13sus2   Db6add9  Dbadd9
What went on when I was a     kid
    Bb7     Bb7sus4  Bb7    Ebm7      Ebm7/Db
I'm lucky I came     out as cool as I did

I'll sing a song and it won't be the blues
Gbmaj9       Ab13
I don't miss Sherwood
  Gbmaj9     Ab13
I won't miss Sherwood
  Gbmaj9     Ab13     Dbadd9
I don't miss Sherwood Forest
