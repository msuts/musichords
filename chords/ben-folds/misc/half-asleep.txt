Unreleased, several demos recorded 1990-1994

[INTRO]
Am9
D7b9
Eaug/G#

[VERSE 1]
Gm7
Half asleep, half a billboard
Fmaj7  Bbmaj7    
Half a street, that's my window
Am7    Dm7
All in all
       Gm7   Am7       Bbmaj7
If you wanna know, I'm half asleep

G7
Old friends and strangers
     Cm7             F7     Bbmaj7
They treat me like a little girl
        Am7        Am7/G
But not you dear
         D/F#        D/E  D
You were always here

[REFRAIN 1]
    D7+         Gm9
But back in the black and white spotlight
      Fm9
And I smoked the packed house
    Gm9
And you were sitting pretty then
     Fm9         Abmaj9
Just like you're doing now
      Ebmaj9            D7/F#
I was something then or so they say
  Bbmaj9          F/C   Faug/C#  D7
I could have gone all   the      way
Dm7                F/C           G7/B    G7
   Like everything else I did it halfway

[VERSE 2]
Gm7
Half asleep, that's where the dreams and 
Fmaj7  Bbmaj7 
Demons meet, say stop the laughter
Am7     Dm7
Dim the roar
     Gm7         Am7   Bbmaj7
This clown's not funny anymore

G7
Friends used to say that to me
Cm7             F7     Bbmaj7
Treat me like a little girl
        Am7        Am7/G
But not you dear
         D/F#        D/E  D
You were always here

[REFRAIN 2]
     D7+           Gm9
Like back when we tripped the light out of sight
    Fm9
The band would play
            Gm9
I'd sing my heart out for a drunken crowd
   Fm9           Abmaj9
It didn't mean a thing
           Ebmaj9        D7/F#
Oh we were so in love, I loved you so
Bbmaj9  F/C            Faug/C#  D7
That it seemed like an hour    ago
Dm7                F/C           G7/B    G7

[BRIDGE]
    Ab       Cm/G     F7
And when I'm down and out
  C      G/B    Am7  G6
I try to figure out
     Ab          Cm6               F7
What was it all about? Why was the spark always there?
  C         G/B       
I only know now
  Dm7        Fmaj7b5/G
I wanna take another breath

[OUTRO]
Gm7
Half asleep, do do do do do
Fmaj7  Bbmaj7    
Do do  Do      Do do do do do
Dm7              C/E       F
No keep talking, I'm still here
Dm7                     C/E     F
Don't let them take you away my dear
Dm7           C/E      F              Bbmaj9
Someone said "He can't hear you, he's half asleep"

Abmaj9
Half asleep

Bbmaj9  Abmaj9
Bbmaj9  Abmaj9
Bbmaj9  Abmaj9
