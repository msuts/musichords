[VERSE 1]
Gmaj9                                        Cmaj7
     If you want to write a letter, write a letter
Gmaj9                                            Cmaj7
     If you'd rather make a phone call, pick the phone up, call me
Am
   But if you had to say it all with a pop song
Cmaj7                           D
     Couldn't you at least have written me a good one?

[CHORUS 1]
      C                C/D              C/E              C/F#         Gmaj9
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
      C                C/D              C/E              C/F#         Gmaj9
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
D                      Am
  Was it just a simple rewind and erase?
D                       Am
  Was your mind squeaky-clean in the first place?

[VERSE 2]
Gmaj9                                     Cmaj7
     If you gotta write an essay, do your research (If you got to)
Gmaj9                                         Cmaj7
     Stick your nose in a boy-and-girl fight, hear both sides first
Am
  There's something wrong being copied on a memo
Cmaj7                 D
     In the form of a bad country demo

[CHORUS 2]
      C                C/D              C/E              C/F#         Gmaj9
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
      C                C/D              C/E              C/F#         Gmaj9
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
D                           Am
 Is there a funnel from her mind to your mouth now?
D                        Am
 Cause you don't edit anything; it just comes out

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]

[BRIDGE]
        Fmaj7
I gotta say (gotta say)
                                   Ebmaj7
It's pretty gay, trading jabs with pop song, so
Gmaj9                                        Cmaj7
     Maybe next time we should just have a dance-off
  Fmaj7
A dance-off

[VERSE 3]
Gmaj9                                         Cmaj7
     Isn't there something in the Bible about forgiveness and love?
Gmaj9                                                Cmaj7
     And more importantly, about throwing stones and what your house is made of?
Am
  You might reflect upon your own arrangement
Cmaj7                D
     In '94, getting blown in your basement (While your wife slept!)

[CHORUS 3]
      C                C/D              C/E              C/F#         Gmaj9
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
      C                C/D              C/E              C/F#         Gmaj9
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too

[OUTRO]
      Am
She's brainwascht you (Integrity)
      C
She's brainwascht you (Family)
      Am                                         C
She's b-b-brainwascht you (Online rhyming dictionary)
