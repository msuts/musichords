[VERSE 1]
C        Cmaj7     C6                  G/C
  Here in  Cologne   I know I said it wrong
C                      Cmaj7  C6                 G/C
  I walked you to the train     and back across alone
Am            E7    F             D7     
  To my hotel room   and ordered me some food
C/G           G                 Fmaj7                             
  And now I'm wondering why the floor has suddenly become a moving target

[CHORUS 1]
C            Cmaj7
Four, three, two, one,
    Am          G
I'm letting you go
C      Cmaj7
I will let go
   Am           G
If you will let go
Ab          
Four, three, two

[VERSE 2]
C              Cmaj7     C6                 G/C
  Says here an astronaut    put on a pair of diapers
C                Cmaj7  C6                G/C
  Drove eighteen hours    to kill her boyfriend
Am                E7                 F                   D7     
  And in my hotel room, I'm wondering if you read that story too?
C/G         G             Fmaj7     
  And if we both might be having the same imaginary conversation

[CHORUS 2]
C            Cmaj7
Four, three, two, one,
    Am          G
I'm letting you go
C      Cmaj7
I will let go
   Am           G
If you will let go
Ab          
Four, three, two

[BRIDGE]
G
Ohhhhh-aah
Fmaj7           C
Weightless as I close my eyes
G
Ohhhhh-aah
Fmaj7             C
The ceiling opens in disguise

[BRIDGE]
Am               E7    F             D7
  Such a painful trip   to find out this is it
C/G        G                     Fmaj7
  And as I go to sleep you'll be waking up

[CHORUS 3]
C                 Cmaj7
Four, three, two, one,
    Fmaj7       G
I'm letting you go
C      Cmaj7
I will let go
Fmaj7           G
If you will let go
