VERSE:
C       Cmaj7    C6                  G/C
Here in Cologne     I know I said it wrong
C                   Cmaj7  C6                 G/C
I walked you to the train     and back across alone
Am          E     F                 D7     
To my hotel room     and ordered me some food
C/G         G                 Fmaj7                             
And now I'm wondering why the floor has suddenly become a moving target

Chorus:
C            Cmaj7
Four, three, two, one,
    Am          G
I'm letting you go
C      Cmaj7
I will let go
   Am           G
If you will let go
Ab          
Four, three, two

VERSE 2:
Says here an astronaut put on a pair of diapers
Drove eighteen hours to kill her boyfriend
And in my hotel room, I'm wondering If you read that story too?
And if we both might be having the same imaginary conversation

[Chorus]

G
Ohhhhh-aah
Fmaj7           C
Weightless as I close my eyes
G
Ohhhhh-aah
Fmaj7             C
The ceiling opens in disguise

Am             E     F              D7
Such a painful trip     To find out this is it
C/G      G                     Fmaj7
And as I go to sleep You'll be waking up

C                 Cmaj7
Four, three, two, one,
    Fmaj7       G
I'm letting you go
C      Cmaj7
I will let go
Fmaj7           G
If you will let go


G
Ohhhhh-aah
Fmaj7     C
Ohhhhh-aah
G
Ohhhhh-aah
Fmaj7     C
Ohhhhh-aah

G Fmaj7 C x2

C Cmaj7 Am Cmaj7 x2
