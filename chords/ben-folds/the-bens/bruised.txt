[VERSE 1]
G#m  E   G#m                  E
Oh   no, love just leaves you bruised
               G#m   E
If you want to know
    G#m               E
You find something to lose

    G#m                E
The world won’t turn until something breaks
G#m               E
Who will make the first last mistake
    G#m                  E                 G#m   E
You say that good things come to those who wait

[PRECHORUS 1]
F#   E      
     Into the spiral
F#   E
     Your world and my world

Love just leaves you bruised

I went because you said you’d be there

A box of candy, smoke in your hair
     B        F#    B/D#     E
When I didn’t know, I didn’t care
B         F#    B/D#     E      F#  G#m  F#  G#m  F#  G#m
But now I know, ba ba ba ba ba

Love just leaves you bruised

You got to go   slow

‘Cause love just leaves you bruised
