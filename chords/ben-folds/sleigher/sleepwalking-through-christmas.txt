[VERSE 1]
Bb          Dm              Ebmaj9
   I'm sleepwalking through Christmas
Bb           Dm           Ebmaj9
   Everybody thinks that I'm     awake
  Bb            Dm
I keep my eyes open
    Ebmaj9
I'm eloquently spoken
         Bb       Dm       Ebmaj9
Oh, this might be    the year
              Bb  Dm  Ebmaj9
I make a change

[VERSE 2]
Bb          Dm              Ebmaj9
   I'm sleepwalking through Christmas
Bb                Dm        Ebmaj9
   Dashing to the loo with my      phone
   Bb         Dm
To get just a sliver
     Ebmaj9                   
Of a life  that's gone unlived with her
Bb       Dm            Ebmaj9
My love,    what's it going to take?
Gm               F/A       Bb
   And what will everybody think?

[BRIDGE 1]
          Dm
Floating away I spend my days
        Cm                    Bb
Out of body and far above the haze
              Abmaj7
Dreaming as I go     through motions
Gm7                     Dbmaj7  Cm7  F
Knowing she's an ocean away
Bb          Dm      Ebmaj9
   I'm sleepwalking

[BRIDGE 2]
    Dm
Oh, why, why do I keep thinking
Cm7                   Bb
Dreams might leave me alone?
                Abmaj7
Why am I always dying just to please
Gm7
Lying to make it easy
Dbmaj7       Cm7
Oooh, when being true
           F
Can be the greatest gift of all?

Bb          Dm              Ebmaj9
   I'm sleepwalking through Christmas
Bb        Dm           Ebmaj9
   On the eve of being brave
    Bb             Dm      Ebmaj9
The table's fallen silent
            Bb          Dm  Ebmaj9
This might be the year
