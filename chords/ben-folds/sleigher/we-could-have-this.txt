[VERSE 1]
Dadd9
      I never cared for snow
    Dsus4/E
But gosh    I love the snow
    F#m7       G  A
Now we're both in it
Dadd9                        Dsus4/E
      Hard to remember who I was
                   F#m7  G  A
Before I knew that you exis-ted

F#m7                    G           Dadd9
    Another holiday and we're still here
F#m7
    Not quite together yet
    G              A
But we are growing nearer
        Bm7      F#m7
But for time and space
    G       D
And lives arranged
    C2
The joy and pain

[REFRAIN 1]
         G2  Gmaj9  A6
Thinking we  could  have this

[VERSE 2]
Dadd9                               Dsus4/E
      I'll wait outside in freezing cold
                    F#m7           G  A
A sleeping bag outside   your door
Dadd9
      The last few Christmases
                    Dsus4/E
It seemed so out of reach
             F#m7     G    A
But now it's just one more

F#m7                        G       Dadd9
     I never even knew that I could wish this
F#m7                              G
     And when you hold me I could cry
              A                   Bm7      F#m7
We could have missed this but for time and space
    G       D
And lives arranged
     C2
Some joy some pain
    D/A    A
And by the way

[REFRAIN 2]
Gmaj9      A6
We   could have this
Gmaj7      A6             
We   could have this next Christmas

[VERSE 3]
Dadd9
      Another year, another laugh, another cry
            Dsus4/E     G  A
And another good    morning
Dadd9
      Another hi, another heart, another cloud
        Dsus4/E   G    A
Another goodnight dear

F#m7                  G       Dadd9
     Another year can seem so far
F#m7
     But what it's clear
     G            A
It's just a few tomorrows
        Bm7      F#m7
But for time and space
    G       D
And lives arranged
     C2
Some pain, some change
     D/A        A
Some time to wait

[REFRAIN 3]
    Gmaj9         A6
But we could have this
Gmaj9       A6
We    could have this
Gmaj9       A6
We    could have this
Gmaj9       A6
We    could have this
