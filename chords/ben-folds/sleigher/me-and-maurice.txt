ME AND MAURICE by BEN FOLDS
From the album SLEIGHER (2024)

[INTRO]
Dm7  Em  F  G
C5

[VERSE 1]
          C5
Christmas Eve, a silver blanket
C5/F
Spreads into the night
        C5
Distant sounds of bells and laughter
C5/F
Plastic joy and light

     Em7           Am9
Past floorplan variations
Fmaj9
More or less the same
       C
I walk Maurice
      G              Am/G  G
And a full green bag of    shame

[PRECHORUS 1]
Fmaj9
Giant inflatable Santa Clauses
Em7       Am9
Smile and wave
      Fmaj9
As we head back through the snow
       G           Am/G  G
To the dark end of the   lane

[CHORUS 1]
                 C  Cmaj7  C6  C
Where me and Maurice
                Fmaj9  G/F  Fmaj9  C/E
We're digging a hole
                Dm9     Dm
The yard's on a freeway
                       Fmaj9  G
We don't know where it goes
              C     Cmaj7  C6  C
Santa Monica, maybe
                      Fmaj9  G/F  Fmaj9 C/E
Or all the way to the North       Pole

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]
Dm7  Em  F

[VERSE 2]
        C5
Winter sun is rising
Fmaj9
Blurry and bizarre
C5           Cadd9       C5
Last night's air-pump Santas
        F       Fmaj9              F
Are all face-up in     their yards

Em7          Am9
Frozen and deflated
Fmaj9
Hungover and sad
          C
Do they remember Christmas past
    G           Am/G  G
And all the fun we    had?

[PRECHORUS 2]
               Fmaj9
You think that life  is always gonna be one way
         Em7                  Am9
And in a minute it turns on a dime
              Fmaj9
Now it's just me    and Maurice
      G             Am/G  G
We're gonna be fine

[CHORUS 2]
                  C  Cmaj7  C6  C
'Cause me and Maurice
                Fmaj9  G/F  Fmaj9  C/E
We're digging a hole
                Dm9     Dm
The yard's on a freeway
                       Fmaj9  G
We don't know where it goes
              C     Cmaj7  C6  C
Santa Monica, maybe
                      Fmaj9  G/F  Fmaj9 C/E
Or all the way to the North       Pole

[PRECHORUS 3]
  Fmaj9
A happy band of carolers
Em7           Am9
Ring the doorbell twice
          Fmaj9
Then they turn  and disappear
  G        Am/G  G
Into the silent  night

[CHORUS 3]
                 C  Cmaj7  C6  C
Where me and Maurice
                Fmaj9  G/F  Fmaj9  C/E
We're digging a hole
                Dm9     Dm
The yard's on a freeway
                       Fmaj9  G
We don't know where it goes
            C      Cmaj7  C6  C
Will anyone wonder?
            Fmaj9  G/F  Fmaj9  C/E
Will anyone know?
