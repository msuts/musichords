[VERSE 1]
          Bbmaj7
Christmas morning
                              Abmaj7
In the back of the old family Ford
        Bbmaj7
With my feet dangling 
                               Abmaj7
Wondering when they might grow to the floor

        Ebmaj7
Pumpkin pie    wrapped in foil
    Dbmaj7
And gifts wrapped in newspaper
                       Ebmaj7
Ringing the bell of my grandmother's door
        Dbmaj7            Cm7
All the memories that the seasons store

[VERSE 2]
          Bbmaj7
Christmas time
                               Abmaj7
Like a rhyme at the end of the year
    Bbmaj7
A familiar, a constant 
                             Abmaj7
That makes all of life's changes     clear

            Ebmaj7
Well it's a long   way to go
     Dbmaj7
From yuletide to sunshine through fiery red fall
         Ebmaj7
One last dash  to the mall
         Dbmaj7             Cm7
And in a flash it all slows down again
               Bb/F         F
And we've come 'round again

[CHORUS 1]
          Bbmaj7
Christmas time
       Gm7                     Abmaj7    Eb/F  F  
What a wonderful time tripping holiday
       Bbmaj7
We are windswept and dazed
       Gm7                Abmaj7         Eb/F  F
By the last weird trip 'round    the sun

[BRIDGE]
Gbmaj7                  Dbmaj7
Some   come by walk and some   come by pram
Gbmaj7                    Dbmaj7
One   drives his mid-life crisis Trans Am
    Gbmaj7                Dbmaj7
And me in the corner here nursing a dram
        Eb  F
And I'm feeling fine
     Eb    F
It's Christmas time
Eb  F
Oh, yeah

         Ebmaj7
Precious moments like these
              Dbmaj7
They mean the world to me, listen, you're all fuckin' freaks
          Ebmaj7
But we're family
      Dbmaj7
So we do     what it takes
   Cm7
To be in one place
   Bb/F           F  C/G  G
If just for a day

[CHORUS 2]
          Cmaj7
Christmas time
       Am7                   Bbmaj7  F/G  G
What a wonderful bittersweet holiday
     Cmaj7                    
We arrive half alive
         Am7               Bbmaj7         F/G  G
From the last weird trip 'round   the sun
         Abmaj7                  Ebmaj7
So let's drink to old Baxter who snored in his chair
      Abmaj7                        Ebmaj7
Let's mourn for the nephews and the loss of their hair
        Abmaj7
There's buns   in the oven
        Ebmaj7
There's change in the air
        F   G
And I'm feeling fine
     F     G
It's Christmas time
F   G
Oh, yeah
F   G
Oh, yeah
