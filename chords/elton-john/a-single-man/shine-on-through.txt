Shine on Through - Elton John

INTRO:
Eb  Bb/Eb  Ab/Eb  
Eb  Bb/Eb  Ab/Eb

VERSE:
Eb        Bb/Eb
Oh my love

       Ab                  Eb
I have cursed the stars above

     Bb      F        Bb  Bb/Ab
That lead my heart to you

CHORUS:
Eb/G               Ab
But as hard as I try

         Bb   G/B      Cm  Abm
Still my love will not die

        Eb/Bb       Bb       Ab      Eb F
And the stars still shine on through

        Eb/Bb       Bb       Ab      Eb
And the stars still shine on through

VERSE:
Eb    Bb/Eb
Oh my dear

         Ab                   Eb
Now this ship's too hard to steer

    Bb       F                 Bb  Bb/Ab
The tide has turned, turned on you

CHORUS:
       Eb/G              Ab
I have been through the lies

     Bb        G/B     Cm   Abm
That I've seen in your eyes

        Eb/Bb       Bb        Ab      Eb F
But the truth still shines on through

        Eb/Bb          Bb                Ab      Eb
But the truth it still shines, shines on through

BRIDGE:
Db Ab              Bb          Eb              
So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill

Gm/D   Gm Cm            Bb Ab
Though we took our love so daringly

    Bb      G/B Cm
And gave it up  uncaringly

          F7                            Bb    
There are feelings left not even we can kill  Oh_____!

VERSE:
Eb    Bb/Eb
Oh my friend

      Ab                Eb
So at last we reach the end

    Bb        F       Bb  Bb/Ab
The lights go down on cue

OUTRO:
       Eb/G      Ab
I have wasted my time

       Bb     G/B   Cm   Fdim7
But it tasted oh so fine

        Eb/Bb      Bb                Ab      Eb F
That my love still shines, shines on through

       Eb/Bb      Bb                Ab  Eb/G
And my love still shines, shines on you
  
    Eb  Bb
On you

Ab  Eb
