[VERSE 1]
Eb        Bb/Eb
Oh my love
       Ab                  Eb
I have cursed the stars above
     Bb      F        Bb  Bb/Ab
That lead my heart to you

[CHORUS 1]
Eb/G               Ab
But as hard as I try
         Bb   G/B      Cm  Abm
Still my love will not die
        Eb/Bb       Bb       Ab      Eb F
And the stars still shine on through
        Eb/Bb       Bb       Ab      Eb
And the stars still shine on through

[VERSE 2]
Eb    Bb/Eb
Oh my dear
         Ab                   Eb
Now this ship's too hard to steer
    Bb       F                 Bb  Bb/Ab
The tide has turned, turned on you

[CHORUS 2]
       Eb/G              Ab
I have been through the lies
     Bb        G/B     Cm   Abm
That I've seen in your eyes
        Eb/Bb       Bb        Ab      Eb F
But the truth still shines on through
        Eb/Bb          Bb                Ab      Eb
But the truth it still shines, shines on through

[BRIDGE]
Db Ab              Bb          Eb              
So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Gm/D   Gm Cm            Bb Ab
Though we took our love so daringly
    Bb      G/B Cm
And gave it up  uncaringly
          F7                            Bb    
There are feelings left not even we can kill  Oh_____!

[VERSE 3]
Eb    Bb/Eb
Oh my friend
      Ab                Eb
So at last we reach the end
    Bb        F       Bb  Bb/Ab
The lights go down on cue

[OUTRO]
       Eb/G      Ab
I have wasted my time
       Bb     G/B   Cm   Fdim7
But it tasted oh so fine
        Eb/Bb      Bb                Ab      Eb F
That my love still shines, shines on through
       Eb/Bb      Bb                Ab  Eb/G
And my love still shines, shines on you  
    Eb  Bb
On you

Ab  Eb
