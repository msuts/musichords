Intro: G - Bm/F# - Em - G/D - C - G/B - Am7 - Bm - C/D

G          Bm/F#    Em   G/D
The last I heard of you
         C               G/B                 Am7     C   	         
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean
G/D        Bm/F#  Em       G/D              C         G/B
So imagine my     surprise      to see you very much alive
                Am7	 
In the English rain again

E7                            Am
   And I can still recall wet afternoons 
C/G                             D
When we were small and simply childish
G           A/G              D/A			
But you've created your own ghost
                         F#/A#             Dsus   D
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

F/G   G                 F/G                    G       C
Oh,   Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
D/C                   G/D
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
         C/E                      D/F#	
You're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
B                    Em      A           Dsus  D
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy
G           Bm         Em                C     D       G
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child

G  Bm/F#   Em  G/D                  C           
I remember still those lazy summer days
G/B	Am7                Bm  C/D
We'd kill out hunting danger
G	Bm/F# Em   G/D		G/D	        	
And we were alien to all outsiders
C           G/B               Am7	   E7
We had no desire to talk to strangers

Outro: C - Bb
