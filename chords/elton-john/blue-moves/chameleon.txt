[INTRO]
G  Bm/F#  Em   G/D
C  G/B    Am7  Bm   C/D  D

[VERSE 1]
G            Bm/F#    Em   G/D
  The last I heard of you
         C              G/B                  Am7  	         
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean
G/D          Bm/F#     Em    G/D            C          G/B
  So imagine my     surprise     to see you very much alive
               Am7	 
In the English rain again

[PRECHORUS 1]
E7                             Am
   And I can still recall wet afternoons 
C/G                      D
  When we were small and simply childish
G              A/G             D/A			
  But you've created your own ghost
                           F#/A#             Dsus    D
And the need you have is more   than most to hide it

[CHORUS 1]
F/G    G              F/G                    G         C
Oh, Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
D/C                    G/D                 C/E
  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil
                     D/F#	
You're a devil in disguise
B                 Em        A            Dsus  D
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy
   G          Bm         Em             C     D       G
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK 1]
G  Bm/F#  Em   G/D
C  G/B    Am7  Bm   C/D  D

G    Bm/F#      Em  G/D           C           
 I remember still      those lazy summer days
     G/B	      Am7
We'd kill out hunting danger
G/D	    Bm/F#  Em    G/D	        	
And we were ali -  en to all outsiders
C               G/B             Am7	
  We had no desire to talk to strangers

[PRECHORUS 2]
E7                             Am
   And I can still recall wet afternoons 
C/G                      D
  When we were small and simply childish
G              A/G             D/A			
  But you've created your own ghost
                           F#/A#             Dsus    D
And the need you have is more   than most to hide it

[CHORUS 2]
F/G    G              F/G                    G         C
Oh, Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
D/C                    G/D                 C/E
  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil
                     D/F#	
You're a devil in disguise
B                 Em        A            Dsus  D
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy
   G          Bm         Em             C     D       G
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child
