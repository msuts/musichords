[VERSE 1]
B
Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
    Bm                           E
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
       Am                                   D
`Cause progress here don't move with modern times
                   F#
There's nothing to steal
            F                   E    
So, there's not a great deal of crime
D   C   B
Oh, oh

B  G/B  A/B  Bm  G/B  A/B  E/B  F/B  Am/B

[VERSE 2]
B
 It sure is hell living in a one horse town
        Bm                     E
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Am                            D
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
              F#                   F                     E     D  C  B
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair, just picking a tune

   And they ain't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
    Bb                          A Bb  A    Bb           C   C#
But if you want to hear Susanna,      then they'll pick all night
        C
They'll pick all night

[VERSE 3]
B
 'Cause it's no dice living in a one horse town
Bm                  E
   Laid back, as my old coon hound
    Am                                               D
And I   just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
                   F#                   F                    E
There's nothing to steal 'cause there's simply nothing much around
D   C   B
Oh, oh

 It sure is hell living in a one horse town
        Bm                     E
