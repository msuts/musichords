Fm7  G7

[VERSE 1]
C             G7/C  C
  You hear it every day
F/A          C/G
Once upon a time they say
Dm            E7              Am
  Once upon a time in this place
             C/G
I looked and saw on your face
Fm6            C/E
  A smile that spoke to me
   G     Dm/G  C    F/C  C
In oh so many  ways

[VERSE 2]
C            G7/C    C
  The Sunday morning bells
F/A             C/G
  Rang out that all was well
Dm          E7        
  Sunshine across the yard
Am               C/G    
  We'd rest when we worked hard
   Fm6            C/E
We take a little time off
     G   Dm/G     C
To appreciate the day

[CHORUS 1]
    C/E           F
And love builds a garden
Bb               Eb
Grew it from the ground up
Ab             Db
Each one of us knowing
      Bb             Eb
Every inch of it was us
   C/E           F
We pulled it all together
Bb           Eb
Hoping and believing
     Ab              Db
That love built this garden
        C7           Fm        Fm7  G7
For the two of us to dream in

[VERSE 3]
C           G7/C   C
 We'd get a little rain
F/A               C/G
Then the sun came out again
Dm                 E7 
  But a frost it's hard to fight
Am              C/G   
  Once it takes hold flowers die
        Fm6          C/E
There's only so much you can do
   G         Dm/G       C
To keep some things alive

[CHORUS 2]
    C/E          F
And love built a garden
Bb               Eb
Grew it from the ground up
Ab             Db
Each one of us knowing
      Bb             Eb
Every inch of it was us
   C/E             F
We pulled it all together
Bb           Eb
Hoping and believing
     Ab              Db
That love built this garden
        C7           Fm      
For the two of us to dream in

[BRIDGE]
Bbm            Ab
   Sad to say,   it's true
Eb          Fm
  Without a lover who
Bbm
Cares as much
Ab              G             G/A  G/B
Well I guess, I guess it goes to   prove

[CHORUS 3]
    C/E           F
And love built a garden
Bb                Eb
Grows it from the ground up
Ab             Db
Each one of you knowing
      Bb            Eb
Every inch of it is trust
    C/E           F
You pull it all together
Bb           Eb
Hoping and believing
     Ab           Db
That love builds a garden
        C7            Fm      
For the two of you to dream in
