G D/G Em C G

[VERSE 1]
           Bm                   C     
You are my weakness, you are my strength
          D                 C            G
Nothing I have in the world makes better sense
            F#                  G
Cause I’m a fish and you’re the sea
             Bm                    C   
When we’re together or when we’re apart
                D                    C           G
There’s never a space in between the beat of our hearts
              F#                   G
Cause I’m the apple and you’re the tree

  One day at a time is all we do

[VERSE 2]
           Bm               C    
You are my woman, I am your man
             D                   C      G
Nothing else matters at all, now I understand
             F#                  G
That I’m the door and you’re the key
      Bm                     C   
Every morning I wake in your smile
             D                         C            G
Feeling your breath on my face and the love in your eyes
                 F#                G
Cause you’re the honey and I’m the bee
