[VERSE 1]
Db                                  Gb          Db
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
                                                      Gb      Db/F
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Eb                                  Ab             Gb
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Bbm                  Ab/C      Db
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
       Gb/Db      Db          Ab       Gb
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
    Gb/Db      Db          Ab          Bbm   
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK 1]

[VERSE 2]
             Db                                 Gb           Db
Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
                                               Gb       Db/F
They always could find us but they never could catch us
            Eb                                      Ab   Gb
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe
Bbm                         Ab/C   Db
We watched the arrested get taken away
         Gb/Db     Db        Ab     Gb
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
       Gb/Db          Db           Ab          Bbm
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

[CHORUS 1]
F                                                  Bbm  Bbm/Ab
'Cause the steam's in the boiler the coal's in the fire
       Gb                     Ab       Db
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
F                                           Bbm  Bbm/Ab
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Eb                     Ab                      
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

       Gb                     Ab       Db
