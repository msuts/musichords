[VERSE 1]
	  Eb	    Bb/D
Turn me loose from your hands
       Ab  Eb/Bb     Bb7            Eb
Let me fly        to distant lands
     F7/A  		     Ab
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Eb/Bb	Bb7	      Eb
Flowers    and forest fountains
Ab	       Eb/Bb  Bb7    Eb
Home along the lanes  of the skyway
	 Eb		 Bb/D
For this dark and lonely room
	     Ab  Eb/Bb  Bb7       Eb
Projects a shadow          cast in gloom
		F7/A
And my eyes are mirrors
       Ab
Of the world outside
	 Eb/Bb
Thinking of    the way
Bb7		  Eb
That the wind can   turn the tide
	  Ab
And these shadows turn
     Eb/Bb  Bb7  Eb
From purple into grey

[CHORUS 1]
	   Ab
For just a skyline pigeon
Eb/Bb		Bb7
Dreaming of the open
Eb
Waiting for the day
       Ab
He can spread his wings
    Eb/Bb  Bb7  Eb   G7/D
And fly   away again
     Cm   D7sus4  D7     Gm
Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
	    Ab
Towards the things
            Eb/Bb  Bb7   Eb   G7/D
You left so very   far behind
     Cm   D7sus4  D7     Gm
Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
	    Ab
Towards the things
               Eb/Bb  Bb7   Eb
You've left so very   far behind

[VERSE 2]
	    Eb
Just let me wake up in the morning
       Bb/D
To the smell of new mown hay
	     Ab		      Eb/Bb
To laugh and cry, to live and die
Bb7    Eb
In the brightness of my day
	  F7/A
I want to hear the pealing bells
	   Ab
Of distant churches sing
	    Eb/Bb
But most of all please free me
Bb7		 Eb
From this aching metal ring
    Ab		  Eb/Bb  Bb7       Eb
And open out this cage towards the sun

[CHORUS 2]
	   Ab
For just a skyline pigeon
Eb/Bb		Bb7
Dreaming of the open
Eb
Waiting for the day
       Ab
He can spread his wings
    Eb/Bb  Bb7  Eb   G7/D
And fly   away again
     Cm   D7sus4  D7     Gm
Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
	    Ab
Towards the things
            Eb/Bb  Bb7   Eb   G7/D
You left so very   far behind
     Cm   D7sus4  D7     Gm
Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
	    Ab
Towards the things
               Eb/Bb         Bb7   Eb
You've left so very, so very far behind
