G  Am  C  D

[VERSE 1]
G
  The seadogs have all sailed their ships
F      C             G
  Into  the docks of  dawn
          D/F#           Am
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
    C                  G
And twiddle with their  thumbs
    Cm             Bb
Oh, Thor above the mountain
                    F
Look down upon your children
              Eb
This is their heaven where they're told
         Dm              G
To bring their galleons

[PRECHORUS 1]
G                     Bm
   Seek you find your place with me
Em
Men of iron, men of steel
A                       C
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
       Eb                                        Dsus4  D
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

[CHORUS 1]
        G            Am           C        D
You can  come to Val-hala in your own time
G             Am        C              D  
  Come to Val-hala seek  and you will find 
G           C  D
  Val-hala
G             Am           C        D
  Come to Val-hala in your own time
G             Am        C              D  
  Come to Val-hala seek  and you will find 
G        C  D
Val-hala

[VERSE 2]
G         
  There's long boats in the harbor
        F          C     G
Which arrive there every hour
         D/F#         Am
With the souls of the heroes
      C                 G
Whose blood lies on the flowers
         Cm            Bb
And this heaven is the home
                           F
Of every man who loves his sword
                   Eb
And he uses it for freedom
                      Dm   G
To preach the word of Thor

[PRECHORUS 2]
G                     Bm
   Seek you find your place with me
Em
Men of iron, men of steel
A                       C
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
       Eb                                        Dsus4  D
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

[CHORUS 2]
        G            Am           C        D
You can  come to Val-hala in your own time
