[VERSE 1]
C              G/B                 Am     C/G
  It's hard to feel what's in your head
          F
Where the gas lamps grow
        C             Dm
And the garbage blows
                 E7
Around the paper stands

[PRECHORUS 1]
      Am
And a baby cried
      C/G
And I saw a light
      F
And I wondered where
      D
And I wondered why
             F
There'd be a loss of life
     C/G    G7
Down here tonight

[CHORUS 1]
C                 F
  Down on Western Ford Gateway
Dm                G         F
   That's a place where the dead say
C                  F
  That a man lives no more
     C7/G     E7/G#    Am  
Than his fair share of days
F         C7/G    E7/G#     Am   F  F/G  G
  Down on Western Ford  Gateway

C                 F
  Down on Western Ford Gateway
Dm                G         F
   That's a place where the dead say
C                  F
  That a man lives no more
     C7/G     E7/G#    Am  
Than his fair share of days
F         C7/G    E7/G#     Am   F  F/G  G
  Down on Western Ford  Gateway

[Verse 2]
C            G/B             Am    C/G
  It flowed upon the cobbled floor
        F
For the bottle's dead
            C           Dm
And they're drunk again
              E7
By the tavern door

[PRECHORUS 2]
      Am
And a baby cried
      C/G
And I saw a light
      F
And I wondered where
      D
And I wondered why
             F
There'd be a loss of life
     C/G    G7
Down here tonight
