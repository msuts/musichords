D               A               E                       A/E  E
  I'm not a rat   to be spat on locked up in this room
D                      A                E                      A/E  E
Those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon
G              A                    E              A/E  E
  Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
G                   D/F#                   B/D#       B
  Make me wish that I    had wings take me high above

[CHORUS 1]
Am7              G    D                  A
    And I looked high  and saw the empty sky
Am7            G     D             A
    If I could only,  I could only fly
G                D/F#         A/E  A
  I'd drift with them in endless    space
G            D/F#            E
  But no man flies from this place

[VERSE 2]
D                 A                E                 A/E  E
  At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
D                    A                     E                A/E  E
  The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far
G                 A                E               A/E  E
  If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
    G                  D/F#     B/D#            B
I'd look down from the heavens upon  the ones I love

[CHORUS 2]
Am7              G    D                  A
    And I looked high  and saw the empty sky
Am7            G     D             A
    If I could only,  I could only fly
G                D/F#         A/E  A
  I'd drift with them in endless    space
G            D/F#            E
  But no man flies from this place ... fly!

    And I looked high  and saw the empty sky

    If I could only,  I could only fly
G                D/F#         A/E  A
  I'd drift with them in endless    space
G                 D/F#            E
  But no man ever flies from this place, yeah

D             A             E                   A/E  E
Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
D                  A                E                   A/E  E
  Some luck I ever got with you and  I wouldn't like to bet
     G                      A          E  
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
   G            D/F#        B/D#            B
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man

[CHORUS 4]
Am7              G    D                  A
    And I looked high  and saw the empty sky
Am7            G     D             A
    If I could only,  I could only fly
G                D/F#         A/E  A
  I'd drift with them in endless    space
G                 D/F#            E
  But no man ever flies from this place... fly on

   Just send up my love
D  A          E
   Ain't seen nothing but tears
D  A        E  
   Now I've got myself
D  A       E
   In this room for years
D    A         E
   I don't see no one
D   A         E
  I never see anyone
