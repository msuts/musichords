SAILS by ELTON JOHN
from the album EMPTY SKY (1969)

[INTRO]
Am6  Bm  Em

[Verse 1]
Em7
  I viewed in my presence
A7
  My hand on my forehead
Em
  And sighting the liners
Bm                Am
  Of mad merchant seamen
Em7
  In search of the living
D                  Am7
  Or the spices of China

[VERSE 2]
Em7
  Lucy walked gently
A7
  Between the damp barrels
Em7
  And shut out my eyes
Bm                      Am
  With the width of her fingers
Em7
  Said she'd guessed the number
D                 Am7
  Of bales in the back room

[CHORUS 1]
E7
  While the seagulls were screaming
A/C#       G/B - Cmaj7
  Lucy was eat   ing
E7
  Then we hauled up our colours
A/C#                   G/B  C
The way the mother had told us
      Am6            Bm          Em
And together we just watched the sails

[GUITAR SOLO]

[CHORUS 2]
E7
  While the seagulls were screaming
A/C#       G/B - Cmaj7
  Lucy was eat   ing
E7
  Then we hauled up our colours
A/C#                   G/B  C
The way the mother had told us
      Am6            Bm          Em
And together we just watched the sails

[VERSE 3]
Em7
Lucy I said
     A7
In a passage of cotton kegs
Em7
  Can we hold hands
Bm                   Am
  I'm sure that it's warmer
Em7
  Then the gulls ate the crumbs
D           Am7
  Of Lucy's sandwich

[CHORUS 3]
E7
  While the seagulls were screaming
A/C#        G/B - Cmaj7
  Lucy was eat    ing
E7
  Then we hauled up our colours
A/C#                    G/B  C
The way the mother had told  us
       Am6           Bm          Em
And together we just watched the sails
