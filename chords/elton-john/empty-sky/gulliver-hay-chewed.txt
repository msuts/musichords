[VERSE 1]
Gm                     D7/F#                Ebmaj7
Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
    F               Bb                            Abmaj7
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
        Bb                                                    Abmaj7
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
        Gm                         Dm
But the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
       Cm                          Dsus4  D7
As the sheep that he locked in the pen

[CHORUS 1]
        G                      F/G
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
       C                             G
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
    G                    F/G
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
C                       G
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

[VERSE 2]
   Gm                       D7/F#              Ebmaj7
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
    F                       Bb                       Abmaj7
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
    Bb
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him
    Abmaj7
And later men came from the town
    Gm                        Dm
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
    Cm                       Dsus4  D7
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn

[CHORUS 2]
        G                      F/G
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
       C                             G
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
    G                    F/G
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
C                       G
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

G                      F/G
Four feet of ground in front of the barn
C                             G
Sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
G                    F/G
Now it lies empty so cold and so bare
C                       G
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there
