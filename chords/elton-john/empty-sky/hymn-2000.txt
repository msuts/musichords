[VERSE 1]
Ab               Db/Ab  
   She chose the soft  center
                              Fm/C
And took it to bed with her mother
        Ab       Gb
And the ideal confusion
    Db        Ab
Was just an illusion
   Bbm                      Fm/C  Cm
To gain further news of her bro - ther
Ab                   Db/Ab
  And the comfort of mother
                              Fm/C
Was just an appeal for protection
        Ab            Gb
For the cat from next door
          Db       Ab
Was found later at four
Bbm                Fm/C   Cm  Bb/D  C/E
    In surgical dissect - ion

[CHORUS 1]
F             Eb         
  And I don't want to be
    Bb         F
The son of any freak
    F               Eb
Who for a chocolate center
    Bb               F
Can take you off the street
    F                       A7
For soon they'll plough the desert
        Dm    F/C        Bb
And God knows where I'll be
   F       C/E   Dm  C       G/B
Collecting submarine numbers
                          C
On the main street of the sea

F             Eb         
  And I don't want to be the son
       F
Of any freak
    F               Eb
Who for a chocolate center
    Bb               F
Can take you off the street
    F                       A7
For soon they'll plough the desert
Dm          F/C          Bb
    And God knows where I'll be
   F       C/E   Dm  C       G/B
Collecting submarine numbers
                          C
On the main street of the sea

[VERSE 2]
Ab           Db/Ab  
   The Vicar       is thicker
                                   Fm/C
And I just can't see through to him
         Ab      Gb
For his cardinal sings
Db                 Ab
   A collection of  hymns
         Bbm                      Fm/C  Cm
And a collection of coins is made after
Ab                   Db/Ab
   And who wrote the Bible
                  Fm/C
Was it Judas or Pilate
     Ab             Gb
Well one cleans his hands
          Db        Ab
While the other one hangs
    Bbm                 Fm/C   Cm  Bb/D  C/E
But still I continue to stand

[CHORUS 2]
F             Eb         
  And I don't want to be
    Bb         F
The son of any freak
    F               Eb
Who for a chocolate center
    Bb               F
Can take you off the street
    F                       A7
For soon they'll plough the desert
        Dm    F/C        Bb
And God knows where I'll be
   F       C/E   Dm  C       G/B
Collecting submarine numbers
                          C
On the main street of the sea

  F                    Eb         
Yes, I don't want to be the son
       F
Of any freak
    F               Eb
Who for a chocolate center
    Bb               F
Can take you off the street
    F                       A7
For soon they'll plough the desert
        Dm    F/C        Bb
And God knows where I'll be
   F       C/E   Dm  C       G/B
Collecting submarine numbers
                          Bb
On the main street of the sea
