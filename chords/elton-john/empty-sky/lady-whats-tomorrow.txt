[INTRO]
F  C  A/C#  Dm  C

[VERSE 1]
F
  Look up little brother
C                       A/C#
  Can you see the clover
Dm
  No not over there
G                   Eb     C
  A little bit left    and over there
F
  Now look and see the lilac tree
C                                   
  The lily pond, the skylark's song
Dm
  The open air but no one cares
G                       Eb  C
   If branches live and die   out there

[PRECHORUS 1]
Am              Dm
  Remember when you were nine
    Am
And I was ten
Am               Dm
  We would run into the wood
Ebmaj7                 Dsus4  D7
No we never will again

[CHORUS 1]
 G
And Lady, what's tomorrow
         D/F#
What's tomorrow anyway
        Em              Bm
If it's not the same as now
         C             D7
It's the same as yesterday
G
Lady, what's tomorrow
        D/F#
Will it be the same as now
         Em                 
Will the farmer push the pen
         D
Will the writer pull the plough

[VERSE 2]
F
  Look up little brother
C
  Can you see the clover
   Dm
Oh sorry but it's over
G                  Eb       C
  Now there's concrete and no clover

[PRECHORUS 2]
Am         Dm
  Remember    when you were nine
    Am
And    I was ten
Am             Dm
  We would run    into the wood
Ebmaj7                           Dsus4  D7
  No we never will, we never will again

[CHORUS 2]
      G
And Lady, what's tomorrow
         D/F#
What's tomorrow anyway
      Em                 Bm
If it's  not the same as now
       C               D7
It's the same as yesterday
     G
Yes, lady, what's tomorrow
          D/F#
Will it be     the same as now
        Em                 
Will the   farmer push the pen
D
  Will the writer pull the plough
C    D              G  D/F#  Em  G7/D 
  Oh Lady, what's tomorrow

C  D  G
