INTRO:
Ab/C Db F/A Bbm F Gb Ab/C Db (2x)

VERSE
Db                                  Gb          Db
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
                                                      Gb      Db/F
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Eb                                  Ab             Gb
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Bbm                  Ab/C      Db
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
       Gb/Db      Db          Ab       Gb
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
    Gb/Db      Db          Ab          Bbm   
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Ab/C Db F/A Bbm F Gb Ab/C Db

VERSE
Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

CHORUS
F                                                  Bbm  Bbm/Ab
'Cause the steam's in the boiler the coal's in the fire
       Gb                     Ab       Db
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
F                                           Bbm  Bbm/Ab
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Eb                     Ab                      
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

BRIDGE:
Db Ab/C Db F/A Bbm F Gb Ab/C Db (x2)

INSTRUMENTAL VERSE - VOICE "OOH/AH"

CHORUS
F                                                  Bbm  Bbm/Ab
'Cause the steam's in the boiler the coal's in the fire
       Gb                     Ab       Db
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
F                                           Bbm  Bbm/Ab
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Eb                     Ab                      
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died
