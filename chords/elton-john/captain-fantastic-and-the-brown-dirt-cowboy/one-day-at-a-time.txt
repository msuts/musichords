You are my weakness, you are my strength
          D                 C            G
Nothing I have in the world makes better sense
            F#                  G
Cause I’m a fish and you’re the sea

VERSE:
When we’re together or when we’re apart
There’s never a space in between the beat of our hearts
Cause I’m the apple and you’re the tree

VERSE:
You are my woman, I am your man
Nothing else matters at all, now I understand
That I’m the door and you’re the key

VERSE:
Every morning I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face and the love in your eyes
Cause you’re the honey and I’m the bee

CHORUS:
One day at a time is all we do
One day at a time is good for us too
You too   you
You____
