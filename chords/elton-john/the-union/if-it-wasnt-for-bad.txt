[INTRO]
Edim A Dm Dm/C Bb Bb/A Gm A Dm

[VERSE 1]
  Bb            C             Dm
I knew from the first night I met you
Bb             C            Dm
Something just wasn't quite right
Bb             C        Dm
Looked like an innocent stranger
    Gm                        A
But something was just out of sight
Bb          C                   Dm
How could I know that you would use me
Bb            C            Dm
Fill out some plan of your own
Bb         C          Dm
I couldn't know you'd abuse me
    Gm                     A
And leave me here hurt and alone

[CHORUS 1]
      Gm         A          Dm
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
      Edim       A             Dm
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
  Bb                  C       Dm
I know that you could be just like you should
      Bb/F       Gm           Dm
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

[VERSE 2]
Bb        C         Dm
  I only saw what I wanted to see
Bb         C           Dm
You were a dream in my mind
Bb            C            Dm
   I'll never know how you never could be
   Gm                   A
It didn't take long for me to find
  Bb              C            Dm
I guess that it's my fault for seeing
Bb          C         Dm
Only what I wanted to see
Bb         C             Dm
I couldn't know you were being
  Gm                     A
A player just acting for me

[CHORUS 2]
      Bb         C          Dm    
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
      Bb         C             Dm
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
  Bb             A       Dm
I know you could be just like you should
      Bb         A            Dm
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

I knew from the first night I met you
Bb             C            Dm
Something just wasn't quite right
Bb             C        Dm
Looked like an innocent stranger

But something was just out of sight
