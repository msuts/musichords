Listen to recording for rhythms during Intro and Instrumental Break.

INTRO:
Edim A Dm Dm/C Bb Bb/A Gm A Dm

VERSE:
  Bb            C             Dm
I knew from the first night I met you
Bb             C            Dm
Something just wasn't quite right
Bb             C        Dm
Looked like an innocent stranger
    Gm                        A
But something was just out of sight

Bb          C                   Dm
How could I know that you would use me
Bb            C            Dm
Fill out some plan of your own
Bb         C          Dm
I couldn't know you'd abuse me
    Gm                     A
And leave me here hurt and alone

CHORUS:
      Gm         A          Dm
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
      Edim       A             Dm
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
  Bb                  C       Dm
I know that you could be just like you should
      Bb/F       Gm           Dm
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

VERSE:
I only saw what I wanted to see
You were a dream in my mind
I'll never know how you never could be
It didn't take long for me to find

I guess that it's my fault for seeing
Only what I wanted to see
I couldn't know you were being
A player just acting for me

CHORUS:
      Bb         C          Dm    
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
      Bb         C             Dm
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
  Bb             A       Dm
I know you could be just like you should
      Bb         A            Dm
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
  Bb             A       Dm

If it wasn't for bad you'd be good
