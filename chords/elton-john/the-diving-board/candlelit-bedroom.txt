[INTRO]
C    A7/C#  Dm9  Fm/Ab
C/G  G      F/C  C
C/G

[VERSE 1]
C
The sound of one heart breaking
F
The sound of someone waking
G                                 F/C      C     G/B
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
Am                          Dm
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
    C/G                    G                C        G
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground

[VERSE 2]
C
For the lost soul on the ledge 
     F
With one last chance to beg
       G                          C     G/B
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
Am                        Dm
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
      C/G                  G              C        G
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

[CHORUS 1]
C                C/E       F
All we need is a candlelit bedroom
        G           G/A   G/B      C      G/B
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
A            A/B    A/C#  Dm      Fm/Ab
Every waking moment you   believe that
C/G              G             F/C    C
Love will always lead you to a better place

[VERSE 3]
C                               F
The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
    G                             C        G/B
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
Am                        Dm
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
    C/G                G                  C     G
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

[CHORUS 2]
C                C/E       F
All we need is a candlelit bedroom
        G           G/A   G/B      C      G/B
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
A            A/B    A/C#  Dm      Fm/Ab
Every waking moment you   believe that
C/G              G             F/C    C       C/E
Love will always lead you to a better place

Every waking moment you   believe that

You must have a little faith in the light of love

You must have a little faith in the light of love
