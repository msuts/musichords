B  F#/A#  C#/G#  F#  C# 

F#
There was a time

      A#m	     C#9     C#\D  D#m  C#4
I was everything and nothing all in one

	 B        F#\A#
When you found me

      G#m			      C#7
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun

 	  F#
I need to tell you

	A#m	       C#9    C#\D    D#m  C#4
How you light up every second of the day

	   B	     F#/A#
But in the moonlight

	 G#m			    C#7
You just shine like a beacon on the bay


	      F#
And I can't explain

         F#\F 		       Bm\F# Em  
But it's something about the way you look tonight

	         G#
Takes my breath away

				   C#
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside

		 F#
And I can't describe

	 G\F#	             A#m\F   D#m           D#m  F#\C#  B
But it's something about the way you look tonight

B     F#\A# C#5\G#   F#  C#
Takes my    breath  away

    B	    C#	 F#        E  B\D#  C#m  E\B  F#  C#
The way you look tonight


       F#
With a smile

    A#m		     C#9     C#\D    D#m    C#4
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart

       B
In all honesty

    G#m				C#
I'm speechless and I don't know where to start

(CHORUS)

The way you look tonight.
