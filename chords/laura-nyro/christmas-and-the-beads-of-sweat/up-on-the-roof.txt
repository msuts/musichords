[Verse 1]
     Cmaj9                 Am         Em7
When this old world starts getting me down
    Dm9                 G              Cmaj9    
And people are much too much for me to take
C  Cmaj9  C   Cmaj9  C  Cmaj9  C
Up   on   the roof

  Cmaj9                 Am         Em
I climb right up to the top of the stairs
    Dm9               G                Cmaj9     
And all my cares just drift right into space

G/A  G  C  G/A  G  C

[Chorus]
F  Bb/F  C/F  Bb/F     F    Bb/F  C/F   Bb/F  F
On the   roof,     the on - ly    place I     know

Bb/F  C/F  Bb/F  F  Bb/F  C/F  Bb/F

      Em7      G/A     Em7     G/A     Dm
Where you just have to wish to make it so
G           C     G/A  G  C  G/A  G  C
  Up on the roof

[Verse 2]
     Cmaj9              Am        Em7
When I get home feeling tired and beat
  Dm9             G                Cmaj9
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
C  Cmaj9  C   Cmaj9  C  Cmaj9  C
Up   on   the roof

  Cmaj9             Am       Em
I get away from the hustling crowd
    Dm9               G                 C
And all that rat-race noise down in the street

C  Cmaj9  C  Cmaj9  C  Cmaj9  C

[Chorus]
   F     Bb/F  C/F   Bb/F  F  Bb/F  C/F  Bb/F  F
At night the   stars put   on a     show for   free

Bb/F  C/F  Bb/F  F  Bb/F  C/F  Bb/F

Em7      G/A     Em7      G/A      Dm
Darling, you can share it all with me
      G
Let's go, I keep a telling you

[Verse 3]
Cmaj9       Cmaj9      Am        Em7
Right smack dab in the middle of town
     Dm9         G                   C
I've found a paradise that's trouble proof

C  Cmaj9  C   Cmaj9  C  Cmaj9  C

    Cmaj9                Am          Em7
And if this world starts getting you down
        Dm9             G  
There's room enough for two 
            C  Cmaj9  C   Cmaj9  C  Cmaj9  C
Up on the roof

[Outro]
          Am             C
Up on the roof, come on, baby
                        Am
Come on, baby up on the roof
Fmaj7  Em7  Dm7  Cmaj7      
Up     on   the  roof
