[INTRO]
A  E  D  E

[VERSE 1]
                  A
I'm not ready for Christmas
                      E
I'm not ready for the freezing cold
                      D
I'm not ready for the questions 
                        E
They're going to ask me back home
                      A
I'm not ready for the questions 
                       E
That my family's gonna ask of me
                      D
What happened to that pretty girl 
        E
She was so sweet
 
[CHORUS 1]
                       D             A
Well don't you think I know that you were 
    E                A
The perfect sound to comfort me
                   D      A      E
Now all I have are silent nights alone
              A  E  D  E
I'm not ready
 
[VERSE 2]
                  A
I'm not ready for Christmas 
                      E
I'm not ready for the falling snow
             D                    E
Not ready to move on and find somebody new
                   A                            E
I'm not ready to explain why I'm returning this diamond ring
             D
It fit my finger perfectly
                         E
I know you measured it extensively
 
[CHORUS 2]
                       D             A
Well don't you think I know that you were 
    E                A
The perfect sound to comfort me
                   D      A      E
Now all I have are silent nights alone
                   D      A      E
Now all I have are silent nights alone
 
[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]
A  E  D  E

[BRIDGE]
         D       E
Maybe in another life 
        A                 D
We'd be walking down that aisle
          D            E
But under white string lights 
          A                D
You'll go left and I'll go right
    D                E             A
And wish each other another silent night
 
[CHORUS 3]
                       D             A
Well don't you think I know that you were 
    E                A
The perfect sound to comfort me
                   D      A      E
Now all I have are silent nights alone
                       D             A
Well don't you think I know that you were 
    E                A
The perfect sound to comfort me
                   D      A      E
Now all I have are silent nights alone
                   D      A      E
Now all I have are silent nights alone
                  A
I'm not ready for Christmas
