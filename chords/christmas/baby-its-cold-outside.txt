  C            G
I really can't stay
            C       G
(Baby, it's cold outside)
     Dm        G
I've got to go away
            Dm      G
(Baby, it's cold outside)

     C           G
This evening has been
                  C          
(Been hoping that you'd drop in)
        Gm
So very nice
                C7
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

   F           C        F
My mother will start to worry
            C
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
   D/F#           D             
My father will be pacing the floor
 G
(Listen to the fireplace roar)

C                    
So really I'd better scurry
A
(Beautiful, please don't hurry)
    Dm
But maybe just a half a drink more
G
(Put some records on while I pour)

    C               G
The neighbors might think
            C       G
(Baby, it's bad out there)
     Dm             G
Say, what's in this drink?
    Dm         G
(No cabs to be had out there)

  C           G
I wish I knew how
      C             
(Your eyes are like starlight)
              Gm
To break this spell
                C7
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

  F                    C
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
 F         C       D/F#
(Mind if I move in closer?)
   D/F#            D
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
G
(What's the sense in hurting my pride?)

  C            G
I really can't stay
             A
(Baby, don't hold out)
             D    G7    C
Oh, but it's cold out - side

C Am Dm G
C Eb Ab G

  C           G
I simply must go
            C       G
(Baby, it's cold outside)
    Dm        G
The answer is no
 Dm         G
(Baby, it's cold outside)

     C           G
This welcome has been
     C
(How lucky that you dropped in)
            Gm
So nice and warm
              C7
(Look out the window at that storm)

   F           C
My sister will be suspicious
 F               C
(Gosh, your lips look delicious)
   D/F#            D
My brother will be there at the door
 G
(Waves upon a tropical shore)

   C
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
 A
(Ooh, your lips are delicious)
    Dm
But maybe just a half a drink more
 G
(Never such a blizzard before)

     C          G
I've got to get home
                  C          G
(But baby, you'll freeze out there)
     Dm           G
Say, lend me your coat
                 Dm        G
(It's up to your knees out there)

       C           G
You've really been grand
                   C
(I thrill when you touch my hand)
              Gm
But don't you see
             C7
(How can you do this thing to me?)

        F           C
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
 F           C
(Think of my life long sorrow)
   D/F#                D
At least there will be plenty implied
 G
(If you caught pneumonia and died)

  C            G
I really can't stay
               A7
(Get over that hold out)
             D7   G7    C
Oh, but it's cold out - side
