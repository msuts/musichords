I JUST WASN'T MADE FOR THESE TIMES by THE BEACH BOYS
from the album PET SOUNDS (1966)

[VERSE 1]
Gm7/C                Bbadd9
I keep looking for a place to fit in
	 Ebm/Ab          Dm7/G
Where I can speak my mind
    Gm7/C                    Bbadd9
And I've been trying hard to find the people
	 Ebm/Ab          Dm7/G  G7-9
That I won't leave behind

	 Eb        Eb/F
They say I got brains
		 Dm7         Gm7   Dm7/G
But they ain't doin' me no good
			  Fdim7/G
I wish they could

[PRECHORUS]
Cm7       Dm7/C           Cm7     Dm7/C
Each time things start to happen again
Cm7           Dm7/C          Cm7         Dm7/C              F7/C
I think I got something good goin' for myself but what goes wrong

[CHORUS]
Cm7              F
Sometimes I feel very sad
Cm7              F
Sometimes I feel very sad
		[something put my heart into soul into]
Cm7              F
Sometimes I feel very sad
		[something put my heart into soul into]

Eb  A7  Dm7/G  Fdim7/G

Cm7     Dm7/C  Cm7         F6        Bb/C  Bb  Bb/Ab  Bb/G
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

[VERSE 2]
Gm7/C                Bbadd9
Every time I get the inspiration
Ebm/Ab            Dm7/G
To go change things around
Gm7/C                   Bbadd9
No one wants to help me look for places
  Ebm/Ab              Dm7/G  Fdim7/G
Where new things might be found
Eb          Eb/F
Where can I turn
	Dm7          Gm7         Dm7/G
When my fair-weather friends cop out
			  Fdim7/G
What's it all about

[PRECHORUS]
Cm7       Dm7/C           Cm7     Dm7/C  (chords implied by BG vocals)
Each time things start to happen again
Cm7           Dm7/C          Cm7         Dm7/C              F7/C
I think I got something good goin' for myself but what goes wrong

[CHORUS]
Cm7              F
Sometimes I feel very sad
Cm7              F
Sometimes I feel very sad
		[something put my heart into soul into]
Cm7              F
Sometimes I feel very sad
		[something put my heart into soul into]

Eb  A7  Dm7/G  Fdim7/G
