                             "Caroline, No"
                      (Brian Wilson / Tony Asher)	

The right-hand harpsichord part is actually quite simple; the tracking
session on the box set (in C; the released version was sped up to Db)
shows it to be:

	Em     Esus     Dsus
	/   /   /   /     /   /   /   /

... where Em is voiced as B-E-G,  Esus as B-E-A,  Dsus as A-D-G.  Tranpose
accordingly to play along with the sped-up version, and no, don't ask me
how to replicate these voicings on guitar - try Ab6 and Gb6 instead.

Verse 1:
	
	Em/G  Esus/G   Dsus/C
	Where did your long hair go
	Em/G  Esus/G        Dsus/C
	Where is the girl I used to know
	Em/G  Esus/G    Gm7       Gm7/C  Fmaj7/C
	How   could you lose that happy  glow
	           Dsus/F
	Oh Caroline, No

Verse 2:
	Em/G  Esus/G    Dsus/C
	Who   took that look away
	Em/G  Esus/G         Dsus/C
	I   remember how you used to say
	Em/G  Esus/G  Gm7         Gm7/C      Fmaj7/C
	You'd never   change, but that's not true
                   Dsus/F
	Oh Caroline, you

Bridge:
	
	         Dm7      G7      Cmaj7
	Break my heart, I want to go and cry
	        Bm7b5  Fdim    Am
	It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
	           Dm7b5/Ab
	Oh Caroline, why

Verse 3:
	Em/G    Esus/G       Dsus/C
	Could I ever find in you again
	Em/G        Esus/G           Dsus/C
	Things that made me love you so much then
	Em/G     Esus/G          Gm7       Gm7/C     Fmaj7/C
	Could we ever bring them back once they have gone *
	           Dsus/F
	Oh Caroline, No
