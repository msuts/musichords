from the album MIU ALBUM (1978)

[VERSE 1]
C#m7                        A6
    Now that I have lost my Diane
           E/B        G#m7     F#m7
There's no plan as to where to go
C#m7                       A6
    It was hard to lose my Diane
    E/B    G#m7     F#m7  F#m7/B
Now I just miss her so

[CHORUS 1]
E             A       B7           E
Everything is old and nothing is new
E          A     B7           E
All I ever do is   think of you
C#m7     F#7      C#m7      F#7
Memories haunt me night and day
F#m7/B
(Ahhhhhhhhhhh)

[VERSE 2]
C#m7                       A6
    Do you think of me, my Diane
        E/B    G#m7    F#m7
Or have you forgotten me?
C#m7                            A6
    Did you think that you were chained down
    E/B      G#m7    F#m7  F#m7/B
And now that you are free

[CHORUS 2]
E             A         B7           E
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
E            A        B7         E
I want you back with all of my might
C#m7    F#7     C#m7     F#7
Shadows hanging over my head
F#m7/B
(Ahhhhhhhhhhh)
