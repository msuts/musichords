[Verse 1]
             F
Well she's a roller skating child with a ribbon in her hair
    Cm7/F
She gets my heart to beating when I see her there
F
  You know my heart starts smiling when she sings
Cm7/F
     She's such an angel I bet she's got wings

[Chorus 1]
    F/A   Bb         Cm7             Bb       Cm7
And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
      Bb      Eb             Gm7         F
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Bb      Cm7   Bb      Cm7
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee
    Bb           Eb       Gm7     F
She really sends chills inside of me

[Verse 2]
        F
They've got a record playing in the skatin' rink
    Cm7/F
She comes skatin' past me and she gives me a wink
  F
I go and get my skates on and I catch up with her
   Cm7/F
We do it holdin' hands it's so cold I go "brrr"

[Chorus 2]
    F/A   Bb         Cm7             Bb       Cm7
And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down

We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Bb      Cm7   Bb      Cm7
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee

She really sends chills inside of me

[Bridge]
D
Round and around and around we go
          Gm
The music keeps me on my feet
     Cm7                   Cm7/A        D
It's sweet it's sweet it's sweeter than honey
           Gm7              C7
When we're walkin' down the street
(That's right)

[Verse 3]
   F
We run in to the kitchen and we grab a bite
    Cm7/F
Her folks let me stay with her 'til late at night
F
 So many guys want a girl like mine
Cm7/F
     A love like this happens only one time

[Chorus 3]
    F/A   Bb         Cm7             Bb       Cm7
And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
      Bb      Eb             Gm7         F
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Bb      Cm7   Bb      Cm7
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee
    Bb           Eb       Gm7     F
She really sends chills inside of me
