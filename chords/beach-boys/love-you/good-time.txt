[Intro]
B  F#  B  F#

[Verse 1]
   B                      F#7/C
My girlfriend Betty she's always ready
   B/D#           E
To help me in any way
       B/D#                 C#
She'll do my cookin' she's always lookin'
    B/D#                 A#7
For ways she can make my day

[Pre-Chorus 1]
    D#m
And when I'm lookin' at her the sound of pitter patter
   G#
On rainy days like today
      D#m
Could get you feelin' warmer
    C#                            F#8
And you know what-a that can lead to

[Chorus 1]
B                       E
Maybe it won't last but what do we care
   F#                     B
My baby and I just want a good time
      B                      E
Might go up in smoke now but what do we care
   F#                     B                
My baby and I just want a good time

[Verse 2]
   B                       F#7/C
My girlfriend Penny, she's kinda skinny
    B/D#                     E
And so she needs her falsies on
    B/D#                         C#
She don't like cookin' but she's so good lookin'
  B/D#                A#7
I miss her when she's gone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
    D#m
And when she gets to dancin' I feel just like romancin'
 G#
Especially when we're dancing close
       D#m
She'll do the dirty boogie
    C#                     F#7
And that's when I go up in smoke

[Chorus 2]
B                       E
Maybe it won't last but what do we care
   F#                     B
My baby and I just want a good time
      B                       E
Might end up in tears now but what do we care
   F#                     B
My baby and I just want a good time

[Bridge]
B                    F#7
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
 B                            F#7
Wooo woo whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa

[Chorus 3]
B                       E
Maybe it won't last but what do we care
   F#                     B
My baby and I just want a good time
    B                     E              F#
For just a few hours with nu?h what do we care
             B
Let's have a good time

[Outro]
B  E  F#      B
      (Hey!)
