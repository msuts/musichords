Because you're still a baby to me

Cribs and cradles and bottles and   toys

Part of the joys they bring

  Feed you breakfast from a little cup

  Rock you back and forth and make you smile

Drop you in your little tub

Wash your body and shampoo your   hair

Be careful not to sting your eyes

  When it's night I'll put you in your bed

  And I'll bend and kiss you on your head
