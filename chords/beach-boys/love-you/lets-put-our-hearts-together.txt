[Verse 1]
F#maj7                          B/C#
I don't want to tell you that I care for you
                    F#maj7   B/C#
And have you just ignore me
     F#maj7                          B/C#
It's better that I wait and see just how you feel
                  F#maj7  B/C#
And maybe you'll adore me

[Chorus 1]
F#              G#m           F#/A#
  I know you've had so much experience
     B               A#sus4  A#             D#m
That you don't need another  person in your life
G#7
   I know it may sound funny, but you're the kind of woman
C#             G#m7       C#7
  Who'd make a very sweet wife

[Verse 2]
F#maj7                              B/C#
Take your time, don't worry how you feel because
                   F#maj7   B/C#
You know we've got forever
F#maj7                       B/C#
Maybe I'll come up with some idea and
                       F#maj7  B/C#
You'd think that I was clever

[Chorus 2]
F#           G#m           F#/A#
  I've never had someone I need someone
   B                A#sus4  A#  D#m
To live with and be good        to
G#7
   Don't worry about your past loves
                          C#  G#m7  C#7
And if they've never understood     you

[Outro 1]
F#      C#aug   C#m7/F#   F#
  Let's put our hearts  together
B     E7        F#               D#
  And say we'll leave each other never
G#m               C#7              F#
   Let's see what we can cook up between us

[Outro 2]
  A    E7
Toge - ther
  F#   Bmaj7
Toge - ther
  A#m7   G#m7  C#7  F#
Together you   and  I
