THE NIGHT WAS SO YOUNG by THE BEACH BOYS
from the album THE BEACH BOYS LOVE YOU (1977)

[VERSE 1]
    Dbmaj9
The night was so young and everything still
    Ab9
The moon shining bright on my window sill
  Dbmaj9
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
    Ab9
And then I think why does she have to hide

[CHORUS 1]
Db     Dbmaj9                Gbmaj7            Bbm/F  Ebm7
Is somebody going to tell me why she has to hi-ii  -  ide
      F7         Bb      F7         Bb
She's passing it by, she won't even try
   Ebm7                       Gbm    Ab
To make this love go where it should
Gbmaj7/Ab
Doo doo doo doo doo

[VERSE 2]
    Dbmaj9
The sky's turning gray, there's clouds overhead
    Ab9
I'm still not asleep, I'm in my bed
  Dbmaj9
I think of her eyes and it makes me sigh
  Ab9
I think of her voice and it makes me cry

[CHORUS 2]
Db     Dbmaj9                Gbmaj7             Bbm/F  Ebm7
Is somebody going to tell me why she has to lie-ii  -  ie
F7          Bb       F7        Bb
She'd be so right to hold me tonight
Ebm7                      Gbm  Ab
Love was made for her and I
Gbmaj7/Ab
Doo doo doo doo doo

[VERSE 3]
Dbmaj9
It's three o'clock, I go to my sink
Ab9
I pour some milk and I start to think
Dbmaj9
Is she asleep or is she awake
Ab9
And does she think of the love we could make

[CHORUS 3]
Db       Dbmaj9                Gbmaj7                    Bbm/F  Ebm7
Wake up, call me baby call me, tell me what's on your mi-ii  -  ind
F7         Bb      F7             Bb
I've got a car and you're not too far
Ebm7                       Gbm  Ab
Please let me come over to you
Gbmaj7/Ab
Doo doo doo doo doo
