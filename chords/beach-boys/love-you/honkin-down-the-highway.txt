[Verse 1]
E7
Honkin', honkin' down the gosh darn highway
E7
Trying trying to get past them cars
A                                E/G#
Got a, got a little date with an angel
C#m                           F#m
She's the one that said she'd go with me
   B                  E
To see a little movie tonight

[Chorus 1]
A         E/G#               A
Her folks told me that she's lonely
B                E
And she loves me only
      F#m             G         B7
She's used to running away from guys

[Verse 2]
E7
Praying, praying that she'll hold me tight (hoo!)
    E7
And hoping, hoping that she'll see the light
A                              E/G#
Who cares if I got to spend my money
C#m                   F#m
Even if I have to act funny
   B                       E
To go and steal her heart away

[Chorus 2]
A       E/G#                 A
Take it one little inch at a time now
B                  E
'Til we're feeling fine now
  F#m              G        B7
I guess I've got a way with girls

[Break]
E7
Honk honk, honkin' down the highway
E7
Honk honk, honkin' down the highway
E7
Honk honk, honkin' down the highway
E7
Honk honk, honkin' down the highway
A  E/G#  C#m  F#m  B
E7
Honk honk, honkin' down the highway

[Chorus 3]
A       E/G#                 A
Take it one little inch at a time now
B                  E
'Til we're feeling fine now
  F#m              G        B7
I guess I've got a way with girls

[Outro]
E7
Praying praying that she'll hold me tight (yeah)
    E7
And hoping hoping that she'll see the light
E7
Who cares if I gotta spend the night
