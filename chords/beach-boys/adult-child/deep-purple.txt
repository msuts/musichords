[INTRO]
B  Bdim  Amaj7/B  B7

[VERSE 1]
         E           Fdim
When the deep purple falls
     F#m           F#m7/B
Over sleepy garden walls
        E              C#m7
And the stars begin to flicker
       C#m  D#dim  Edim  Fdim
In the sky

[CHORUS 1]
            F#m       Am
Through the mist of a memory
E/G#           Gdim
    You wander back to me
F#m              F#m7/B      E    Amaj7/B
    Breathing my name with a sigh

[VERSE 2]
       E            Fdim
In the still of the night
      F#m             F#m7/B
Once again I hold you tight
              E                    C#m7
Though you're gone your love lives on
               C#m   D#dim  Edim  Fdim
When moonlight beams

[CHORUS 2]
       F#m        Am
And as long as my heart shall beat
E/G#             Gdim
    Lover, we'll always meet
F#m           F#m7/B      E
   Here in my deep purple dream

[CHORUS 3]
       F#m        Am
And as long as my heart shall beat
E/G#             Gdim
    Lover, we'll always meet
F#m           F#m7/B      E
   Here in my deep purple dream
