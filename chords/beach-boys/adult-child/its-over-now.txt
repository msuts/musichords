[VERSE 1]
F#maj9           F#6add9  F#add9  F#9b5
    The flame of love we  had has finally died
F#maj9              F#6add9  F#add9  F#9b5     B6maj9
    Can't take this empti -  ness it left  inside
     A#m7sus4  D#9
It's over now

[CHORUS 1]
             G#msus4           Fdim7/B
And though I played the role I lost my soul
     F#/C#     G#m7b5/D  D#m
It's still within your   heart
     G#/D#   G#dim7/D
It's over  now
     F#/C#   G#7/C
It's over  now
B6maj9             Gmaj9        F#maj9  F#6add9  F#add9  F#9b5
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

F#maj9  F#6add9  F#add9  F#9b5

[VERSE 2]
F#maj9           F#6add9  F#add9  F#9b5
    The noise outside my  window  carries on
F#maj9           F#6add9  F#add9  F#9b5  B6maj9
    Like distant bugles   love is very gone
     A#m7sus4  D#9
It's over now

[CHORUS 2]
          G#msus4         Fdim7/B
It took a part of me, the heart of me
   F#/C#    G#7dim/D  D#m
To watch it fade     away
     G#/D#   G#dim7/D
It's over  now
     F#/C#   G#7/C
It's over  now
B6maj9             Gmaj9        F#sus4  F#  F#sus4  F#
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

[BRIDGE]
F#m     F#m7/B    B9   Emaj9
Heaven, heaven is far away
Em9/A     Em9add6/A  Dmaj9
Angels no longer     play

C#m7  C#7

[VERSE 3]
F#maj9        F#6add9   F#add9   F#9b5
    I need to take this fear and force it down
F#maj9          F#6add9   F#add9  F#9b5  B6maj9
    And just pretend that you are not around
     A#m7sus4  D#9
It's over now

[CHORUS 3]
           G#msus4       Fdim7/B
I'll put a Frank Sinatra album on
    F#/C#  G#7dim/D  D#m
And cry my blues    away
     G#/D#   G#dim7/D
It's over  now
     F#/C#   G#7/C
It's over  now
B6maj9             Gmaj9        F#maj9  F#6add9  F#add9  F#9b5
Shades of blue and purple haunt me
