F           G           Eb            Eb/C  Bb
Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
              C           Gm  F/A  Bb      Bb/C   F
There stood a house and a man who  painted nature scenes
           G     Eb                    Eb/C     Bb             C
He painted trees     and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
       Gm     F/A      Bb      Bb/C     F
And he didn't hear the falling of   the rain

[REFRAIN 1]
F  Caug/E  Cm/Eb  D
   Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  Ah
      Gm     F/A      Bb      Bb/C     F
No he didn't hear the falling of   the rain

F             G             Eb               Eb/C    Bb
In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
        C           Gm     F/A  Bb         Bb/C   F
And she sang as she walked all  around the wooded glade
        G             Eb                Eb/C      Bb           C
She was glad when the rain came falling on    her face and she sang
           Gm      F/A      Bb      Bb/C     F
'Cause she did not mind the falling of   the rain

[REFRAIN 2]
F  Caug/E  Cm/Eb  D
   Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  Ah
      Gm     F/A      Bb      Bb/C     F
No he didn't hear the falling of   the rain

[BRIDGE 1]
                      F                  Am
Will it always be the same as we recall?
                           F                    Am
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
                F                Bb      F/A     G
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
F/C           C               F/C           C
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

[VERSE 3]
F           G        Eb                Eb/C  Bb         C
High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
         Gm   F/A    Bb          Bb/C    F              G
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
        Eb                  Eb/C     Bb            C
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
       Gm       F/A     Bb      Bb/C     F
But he will not see the fallin' of   the rain

[REFRAIN 3]
F  Caug/E  Cm/Eb  D
   Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  Ah
      Gm     F/A      Bb      Bb/C     F
No he didn't hear the falling of   the rain

                      F                  Am
Will it always be the same as we recall?
                           F                    Am
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
                F                Bb      F/A     G
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
F/C           C               F/C           C
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

[VERSE 4]
F            G               Eb               Eb/C       Bb
  So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
         C            Gm     F/A    Bb       Bb/C  F
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
       G          Eb                      Eb/C  Bb             C
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
           Gm    F/A      Bb      Bb/C   F
'Cause you can't stop the falling of the rain

[REFRAIN 4]
F  Caug/E  Cm/Eb  D
   Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  Ah
       Gm    F/A      Bb      Bb/C     F
No you can't stop the falling of the rain
