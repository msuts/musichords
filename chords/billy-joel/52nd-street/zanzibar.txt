Gaug (G B D# G B D# G)
B7 Eaug
Am9 (A E G bassline)

[VERSE 1]
Am9                    F9 (F C Eb bassline)
    Ali dances and the audience applauds
            Am9                                Bbmaj7 (Bb F G bassline)
Though he's bathed in sweat he hasn't lost his style
C               F
  Ali don't you go downtown
C                Am               Bm7b5  E7
  You gave away another round for free,  oh

[VERSE 2]
Am9                      F9
    Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
        Am9                             Bbmaj7
But the waitress always serves a secret smile,  whoa
C                      F
  She's waiting out in Shantytown
C                      F                 Bm7b5  G
  She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
    C
For me

[CHORUS 1]
Gaug                    Cm7
I've got the old man's car,
Fm9                 Bb
I've got a jazz guitar
Ebmaj9            Abmaj7  Gm7  Fm7
I've got a tab at Zan  -  zi - bar
F#m7b5  Gm7          Abmaj7     Ab7(no 5)
To   -  night that's where I'll be
D7      Gaug  B7 Eaug
   I'll be

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK 1]
Am9

[VERSE 3]
Am9                            F9
    Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game
        Am9                              Bbmaj7
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
C             F
  Melodrama's so much fun
C                        Am          Bm7b5  E7
  In black and white for everyone to see

[VERSE 4]
Am9                        F9
    Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
        Am9                           Bbmaj7
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign,  whoa
C                       F
   She's gonna give the go ahead
C                   F            Bm7b5  G
   The inning isn't over yet for me
    C
For me
