[VERSE 1]
D                     D/F#
  Got a call from an old friend
               G            Gsus2    G
We used to be real close
A                                      D    G/D
  Said he couldn't go on the American way
D                             D/F#
  Closed the shop, sold the house
                        G
Bought a ticket to the West Coast
A                                            D
  Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

D                      D/F#                    G       Gsus2
  I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright
A                                                D    G/D
  I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
D                        Dadd2/F#                   G       G  D/F#  Em7  D
  I don't care what you say       anymore, this is my life
A                                            Bm
  Go ahead with your own life, and leave me alone
 
[BRIDGE 1]
                                   F#7/C#
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
D7                                 E9
   I never said I was a victim of circumstance
G2            D/F#  F#7               Bm
   I still belong,      don't get me wrong
E9
   And you can speak your mind
    G/A  A  G/A  A
But not  on my   time
 
[VERSE 2]
D                            D/F#                G             G  D/F#  Em7  D
  They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
A                                                      D    G/D
  Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
D                D/F#                    G        G  D/F#  Em  D
  But sooner or later you sleep in your own space
A                                             D
  Either way it's okay you wake up with yourself
