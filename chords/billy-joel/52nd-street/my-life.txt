VERSE
D                  D/F#
Got a call from an old friend
              G           
We used to be real close
A                                   D    G/D
Said he couldn't go on the American way
D                         D/F#
Closed the shop, sold the house
                       G
Bought a ticket to the West Coast
A                                         D
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright
A                                             D    G/D
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
D                     D/F#                 G       G D/F# Em D     
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
A                                         Bm
Go ahead with your own life, and leave me alone
                                   F#7/C#
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
D7                             E
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
G         D/F#  F#7          Bm
I still belong, don't get me wrong
E7      
And you can speak your mind
    G/A A  G/A A
But not on my  time

VERSE
D                      D/F#                   G             G D/F# Em D   
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
A                                                   D    G/D
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
D             D/F#                    G         G D/F# Em D
But sooner or later you sleep in your own space
A                                         D  
Either way it's okay you wake up with yourself
