I've been watching you waltz all night Diane
         D             Bm          A         
Nobody's found a way behind your defenses
D          A/C#       Bm  G           D/F#     G
They never notice the zap gun in your hand
             D/F#            Em             D/F#    
Until you're pointing it and stunning their senses

Bm  A     G     G   D/F#  Em    G
All night long, all night long
                 D/F#                Bm          A 
You'll shoot 'em down because you're waiting for somebody 
Bm      A    G
good to come on
G  D/F#  Em

You say you're looking for someone so - lid here
             D                    Bm           A            
You can't be bothered with those `just for the night' boys
D         A/C#          Bm           G      D/F#    G
Tonight unless you take some kind of chan - ces dear
         D/F#           Em               D/F#    
Tomorrow morning you'll wake up with the white noise

Bm  A     G     G   D/F#  Em    G
All night long, all night long
            D/F#                  Bm       A
You're only standing there 'cause somebody once did

somebody wrong

But you'll be sleeping with the television on

                     D/G     G    D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
                      A/B  Bm               A/B  Bm  D/G    G
But your attitude is "don't waste my time"
                      D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
          D/G   G                   Bm/A          A
But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be the same

D          A/C#     Bm    G   D/F#     G
This isn't easy for me to say Diane
           D             Bm        A
I know you don't need anybody's protection
D        A/C#       Bm   G         D/F#     G
I really wish I was less of a thinking man
           D/F#            Em         D/F#    
And more a fool who's not afraid of rejection

Bm  A     G     G   D/F#  Em    G
All night long, all night long
             D/F#                 Bm       A    
I'll just be standing here 'cause I know I don't have the
Bm      A    G
guts to come on
G  D/F#  Em
            G                 A          Bm
And I'll be sleeping with the television on

                     D/G     G    D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
                      A/B  Bm               A/B  Bm  D/G    G
But your attitude is "don't waste my time"
                      D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
          D/G   G                   Bm/A          A
But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be somebody
