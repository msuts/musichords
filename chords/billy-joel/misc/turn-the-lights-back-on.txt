TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON by BILLY JOEL
Released as a single (2024)

[VERSE 1]
C               F
Please open the door
           G                          E/G#
Nothing is different, we've been here before
E7/G#        Am               D/F#
Pacing these halls, trying to talk
         Gsus4  G  F  Em
Over the silence
    C                    F
And pride sticks out its tongue
              G                   E/G#
Laughs at the portrait that we've become
E7/G#      Am               D/F#
Stuck in a frame, unable to change
      Gsus4  G  F  Em
I was wrong

[CHORUS 1]
    C             F          G
I'm late, but I'm here right now
         E/G#    E7/G#   Am 
Though I used to be    romantic
     D/F#    G
I forgot somehow
         F    G      C
Time can make  you blind
      F       G
But I see you now
         E      E7/G#     Am
As we're layin' in    the darkness
      D/F#     G
Did I wait too long
            F      G        C
To turn the lights  back on?

[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]
C  F  G

[VERSE 2]
Herе, stuck on a hill
Outsiders inside the homе that we built
The cold settles in
It's been a long winter of indifference
And maybe you love me, maybe you don't
Maybe you'll learn to and maybe you won't
You've had enough, but I won't give up
On you

[CHORUS 2]
I'm late, but I'm here right now
And I'm tryin' to find the magic
That we lost somehow
Maybe I was blind
But I see you now
As we're layin' in the darkness
Did I wait too long
To turn the lights back on?

[PIANO SOLO]

[CHORUS 3]
I'm late, but I'm here right now
Is there still time for forgiveness?
Won't you tell me how?
I can't read your mind
But I see you now
As we're layin' in the darkness
Did I wait too long
To turn the lights back on?

[OUTRO]
I'm here right now
Yes, I'm here right now
Looking for forgiveness
I can see as we're layin' in the darkness
Yeah, as we're layin' in the darkness
Did I wait too long
To turn the lights back on?
