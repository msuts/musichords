[VERSE 1]
D         A/C#         Bm    G   D/F#     G
I've been watching you waltz all night Diane
         D/F#          G           A         
Nobody's found a way behind your defenses
D          A/C#       Bm  G           D/F#     G
They never notice the zap gun in your hand
             D/F#            Em             F#7    
Until you're pointing it and stunning their senses

[CHORUS 1]
Bm  A     G     G   D/F#  Em    G
All night long, all night long
                 D/F#                G            A 
You'll shoot 'em down because you're waiting for somebody 
Bm      A    G
Good to come on
G  D/F#  Em
               G                A          Gmaj7 
But you'll be sleeping with the television on

[VERSE 2]
D              A/C#        Bm      G    D/F#     G
You say you're looking for someone so - lid here
             D/F#                Bm           A            
You can't be bothered with those just-for-the-night boys
D         A/C#          Bm           G      D/F#    G
Tonight unless you take some kind of chan - ces dear
         D/F#           Em               F#7    
Tomorrow morning you'll wake up with the white noise

[CHORUS 2]
Bm  A     G     G   D/F#  Em    G
All night long, all night long
            D/F#                  G        A
You're only standing there 'cause somebody once did 
Bm  A    G
somebody wrong
G  D/F#  Em
              G                 A          Bm
But you'll be sleeping with the television on

[BRIDGE 1]
                     D/G     G    D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
                      A/B  Bm               A/B  Bm
But your attitude is "don't waste my time"
                      D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
          D/G   G                   Bm/A          A
But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be the same 
   Bm/A       A7
old line

[VERSE 3]
D          A/C#     Bm    G   D/F#     G
This isn't easy for me to say Diane
           D/F#          G         A
I know you don't need anybody's protection
D        A/C#       Bm   G         D/F#     G
I really wish I was less of a thinking man
           D/F#            Em         F#7   
And more a fool who's not afraid of rejection

[CHORUS 3]
Bm  A     G     G   D/F#  Em    G
All night long, all night long
             D/F#                 Bm       A    
I'll just be standing here 'cause I know I don't have the
Bm      A    G
guts to come on
G  D/F#  Em
            G                 A          Bm
And I'll be sleeping with the television on

[BRIDGE 2]
                     D/G     G    D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
                      A/B  Bm               A/B  Bm
But your attitude is "don't waste my time"
                      D/G    G
Your eyes are saying talk to me
          D/G   G                   Bm/A          A
But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be somebody

We're only standing here 'cause somebody might do somebody

wrong
G  D/F#  Em
             G                 A          Gmaj7  A  Bm/D
And we'll be sleeping with the television on

Sleeping with the television on
