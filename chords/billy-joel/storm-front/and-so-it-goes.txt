[INTRO]
C    C/E  F    C/E  F    C/G      Asus2  Am
G/B  C    G/B  C    C/E  F        F/A    G
C    C/E  F    C/E  F    C/G      Asus2  Am
G/B  C    C/E  F    F/A  Fmaj9/G  C

[VERSE 1]
   C   C/E  F     C/E   F  C/G  Asus2 Am
In ev' ry   heart there is a    room
G/B  C    G/B C    C/E  F    F/A  G
A    sanctu - ar - y    safe and  strong
   C    C/E  F      C/E  F     C/G  Asus2 Am
To heal the  wounds from lov - ers  past
G/B  C       C/E F/A  Fmaj9/G  C
Un - til a   new one  comes    along

[VERSE 2]
  C     C/E  F   C/E  F      C/G  Asus2 Am
I spoke to   you in   caut - ious tones
G/B  C     G/B C    C/E  F  F/A   G
You  ans - wered me with no pre - tense
    C     C/E  F    C/E  F    C/G  Asus2 Am
And still I    feel I    said too  much
G/B C     C/E  F   F/A  Fmaj9/G  C
My  sil - ence is  my   self     defense

[CHORUS 1]
    C     C/Bb      F/A    Fm/Ab
And every time I've held a rose
   C/G     Am   D        Gsus4  G
It seems I only felt the thorns
    C     C/Bb      F/A   Fm/Ab
And so it goes, and so it goes
    C/G     Am       D/F#  Gsus4   G
And so will you soon I     suppose

[VERSE 3]
    C   C/E  F     C/E   F    C/G  Asus2 Am
But if  my   sil - ence  made you  leave
G/B  C    G/B   C   C/E  F        F/A  G
Then that would be  my   worst mistake
   C  C/E  F     C/E  F    C/G  Asus2 Am
So I  will share this room with you
G/B  C   C/E  F    F/A  Fmaj9/G  C
And  you can  have this heart to break

[PIANO SOLO 1]
C    C/E  F    C/E  F    C/G      Asus  Am
G/B  C    C/E  F    F/A  Fmaj9/G  C

[CHORUS 2]
    C       C/Bb   F/A      Fm/Ab
And this is why my eyes are closed
     C/G     Am       D        Gsus4  G
It's just as well for all I've seen
    C     C/Bb      F/A   Fm/Ab
And so it goes, and so it goes
    C/G        Am   D/F#    Gsus4   G
And you're the only one who knows

[VERSE 4]
   C  C/E   F      C/E  F   C/G  Asus2 Am
So I  would choose to   be  with you
G/B    C   G/B  C      C/E  F    F/A  G
That's if  the  choice were mine to   make
    C   C/E  F    C/E  F     C/G  Asus2 Am
But you can  make de - cis - ions too
G/B  C   C/E  F    F/A  Fmaj9/G  C
And  you can  have this heart to break

[PIANO SOLO 2]
C    C/E  F    C/E  F    C/G  Asus2  Am
G/B  C    G/B  C    C/E  F    F/A    G

[OUTRO]
    C     C/Bb      F/A   Fm/Ab
And so it goes, and so it goes
    C/G        F    Fmaj9/G     C
And you're the only one     who knows
